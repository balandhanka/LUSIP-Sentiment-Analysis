Because virus undergo rapid mutations so anybody cured from Corona can be infected again. Only solution that anybody infected should refrain from public places and people should use masks and hand hygiene.
You will have to live with it like influenza. Corona will peak again in next winter. So make rules and educate people to wear masks in closed rushy places and hand wash regularly with soap when off the place and use hand sanitizer frequently.

Dr yalena... Due to Corona impact...everyone feels lonely... Ur glittering eyes shows ur loneliness.
My auntie forced me to put vix inside my nostrils as itll ‘prevent corona’ 
"Repercussions of deadly #COVID19Pandemic on Pakistan in coming days, 1. Unimaginable death chain (Corona Tigers exposure) 2. Shortage of food supply (crops are damaged by untimely rains) 3. Inter-province disharmony on grants 4. Religious discords 5. Political instability"
"THE SCIENTISTS AROUND THE WORLD ARE BUSY IN FIGHTING THE ""CORONA"" MONSTER !!! I BELIEVE THEY ARE NOT FOCUSING ON THE MAIN REASON FOR SPREAD!!! THE REASON ? WESTERN FOOD, PORK &amp; ALCOHOL, WHICH ABSORBS IN THE HUMAN FLESH &amp; ? IT'S PERFECT BREEDING PLACE FOR CORONA VIRUS!!!"
"In Italy, a child lookingup at the sky and voicing his mother, his mother died to corona virus.He could not even see see his died mother Watch till the end #Stay_Safe_For_pakistan #pray_for_world #COVIDー19 #CoronaFreePakistan "
"In currency CORONA situation how Pakistan is planning to earn money or after this crisis? there is no product except this digital Gold which #WaqarZaka is suggesting, let him put crypto mining farm in KPK using Hydropower or tell us why it is not feasible? #SBPLiftBanOnCrypto"
"#SBPLiftBanOnCrypto In currency CORONA situation how Pakistan is planning to earn money or after this crisis? there is no product except this digital Gold which #WaqarZaka is suggesting, let him put crypto mining farm in KPK using Hydropower or tell us why it is not feasible?/7"
“Govt currently has data of just 12 million people. But since 80 million people are expected to have been hit by this crisis so this is where Corona Tiger Force will help. They’ll identify the needy families &amp; send us the data” 
That's 25% plus positive ratio. If test one million 250 thousands will be corona patients. 
"SIR!! LEAVINGTHE POLITICAL DARKNESS! I WOULD LIKE TO SHARE MY OBSERVATIONS REGARDING THE CORONA VIRUS! THIS IS DISEASE OF WEST &amp; COLD ATMOSPHERES! IT'S ASSOCIATED WITH? FOOD, SPECIALLY PORK &amp; ALCOHOL INTAKE! THE ""FLESH"" OF THE MASSES IS PERFECT BREEDING GROUND FOR CORONA!!!"
"Because of Corona India’s CoinDCX, has raised $3 million from backers including Bain Capital Ventures, signaling that global investors are drawn to the space after a favorable Supreme Court decision,@ImranKhanPTI why not listen to #WaqarZaka #Tenup #SBPLiftBanOnCrypto #WaqarZaka"
The major difference between Sindh Govt and Punjab Govt is that every single minister of Sindh govt is working wholeheartedly to counter Corona virus where only Yasmeen Rashid seems to be at least trying in Punjab Govt. – at Mansehra City
Punjab govt has made corona hall in lahore no privacy for any patients how they will quarantine patients
"Read this , doctors and nurses of an INDIAN hospital resigned due to corona virus and lack of protection equipment like masks and clothing , Pakistani doctors demanded but same time continued serving their patients SALUTES "
"(2) With that difficult decision behind us, we are now turning our focus to the coming weeks and months as CCB has made an initiative for dedicating one of its Dispensary as Corona Community Clinic."
Corona did it for u 
Imagine @YUVSTRONG12 @harbhajan_singh who gave their whole life &amp; career for India being Labelled as Anti National.they tweeted about helping the corona victims in pak. Bhakts started abused them and questioned. These bhakts are more dangerous than corona.

"Which is a better way to kill oneself, Corona or a cricket bat ? Asking for a friend!"
.Corona Virus is spreading by Cosmetics Shops in Malls and General Stores where people (ladies) go for shooing. You should elaborate further for opening only Kiryana Wholesale stores. Retail Shops just be closed at any cost
"Asim Jofa is now designing hazard suits? Please stop corona, I can't take it anymore"
"Homemade masks harmful for use, can prove vulnerable.The use of homemade masks being prepared by tailors amid Corona scare in J&amp;K as “unsafe &amp; harmful. Dr. Nisar Ul Hassan said face masks go through a scientific procedure, using mask is same as prescribing a drug/medicine."
"Once Upon a time, There was spread of ""Spanish Flu"". Same restrictions were announced, This Corona thing will End soon. #ਵਮਕ"
i don't think india will fight covid19... Because the hatred against the Muslims in their hearts must first be abolished۔۔ The corona virus is not just in India but it is worldwide۔۔ But they always targeted muslims۔۔

"In Pakistan while PTI govt is fighting Corona-19, PML-N's busy fighting PM IK. @CMShehbaz is playing politics, promoting himself as ""saviour"" without a plan, belittling PTI 24/7. Has dramebaaz donated ventilators to hospitals, money to Corona Relief Fund, distributed food even?"
"We can't just let prisoners stay with risk of corona infection, we have to ensure their safety too, #CoronaRiskForPrisoners we request release of Sant Shri Asaram Bapu Ji who is above 84"

"With an increase of 232 cases, March 31-April 01 was the second consecutive day of highest number of cases that increased in a day. Pakistan crossed 1,000 cases in around a month. 2,000 cases in 6 days. There are 2039 Corona virus cases with 82 recoveries and 27 deaths."

Need to bring to attention for God forbid the deaths from Corona and their TADFEEN. Dead bodies once watered with chlorinated water are safe to burry. Attendees wearing masks &amp; gloves are safe. Authorities shouldn't scare public. 
"Considering Sant Shri Asaram Bapu Ji's age, health issues, during corona outbreak he should be released, as there is risk for all prisoners, including him too. #CoronaRiskForPrisoners "

"#YNH #COVID19 #life #Death #Myth We need a balanced approach here. We should trust science to deal with epidemics, but we should still shoulder the burden of dealing with our individual mortality and transience."
"#YNH #COVID19 #life #Death #Myth For centuries, people used religion as a defence mechanism, believing that they would exist for ever in the afterlife. Now people sometimes switch to using science as an alternative defence mechanism, believing that doctors will always save them"
"#YNH #COVID19 #life #Death #Myth Perhaps in a century or two science will extend human lives indefinitely, but not yet. With possible exception of a handful of billionaire babies, all of us today are going to die one day &amp; will lose loved ones We have to own up to our transience"
"#YNH #COVID19 #life #Death #Myth All because scientists have made calculations, and recommended closing down holy places. While humanity as a whole becomes ever more powerful, individual people still need to face their fragility."
#YNH #COVID19 #life #Death #Myth Catholic church instructs the faithful to stay away from the churches. Israel has closed down its synagogues. Islamic Republic of Iran is discouraging people from visiting mosques. Temples and sects of all kinds have suspended public ceremonies.
"#YNH #COVID19 #life #Death #Myth We need to have more hospitals, more doctors, more nurses. We need to stockpile more respiratory machines, more protective gear, more testing kits. We need to invest more money in researching unknown pathogens and developing novel treatments."
"#YNH #COVID19 #life #Death #Myth When the vaccine is indeed ready and the pandemic is over, what will be humanity’s main takeaway? In all likelihood, it will be that we need to invest even more efforts in protecting human lives."
"#YNH #life #Death #Myth Just as moviegoers know that Spiderman &amp; Wonder Woman will eventually defeat bad guys &amp; save the world, so we are quite sure that within a few months, perhaps a year, folks in labs will come up with effective treatments for #COVID19 and even a vaccination"
#YNH #COVID19 #life #Death #Myth Our heroes aren’t the priests who bury the dead and excuse the calamity – our heroes are the medics who save lives. And our super-heroes are those scientists in the laboratories.
"#YNH #COVID19 #life #Myth If train company didn’t stint on safety budget, if municipality had adopted better fire regulations &amp; if govt had sent help quicker–people could have been saved. In 21st century, mass #Death has become an automatic reason for lawsuits &amp; investigations."
"#YNH #COVID19 #life #Death #Myth Attitudes today are polar opposite. Whenever some disaster kills many people–a train accident, a high-rise fire, even a hurricane–we tend to view it as a preventable human failure rather than as divine punishment or an inevitable natural calamity"
"#YNH #COVID19 #life #Death #Myth Psychologists might call it “learned helplessness”. People told themselves it was God’s will – or perhaps divine retribution for the sins of humankind. “God knows best. You will see, it will all turn out for the best in the end. Don’t worry."
"#YNH #COVID19 #life #Myth When an epidemic erupted in a pre-modern society such as medieval Europe, people of course feared for their lives and were devastated by the #Death of loved ones, the main cultural reaction was one of resignation."
#YNH #life #Myth Will current pandemic change human attitudes to #Death? Probably not. Just the opposite. #COVID19 will probably cause us to only double our efforts to protect human lives. For dominant cultural reaction isn’t resignation – it is a mixture of outrage &amp; hope.
"#YNH #COVID19 #Death #Myth Many traditional religions have switched focus. Instead of promising some heaven in the afterlife, they have begun to put far more emphasis on what they can do for you in this #life"
#YNH #COVID19 #life #Death #Myth Woody Allen was once asked if he hoped to live for ever in the memory of moviegoers. Allen answered: “I’d rather live on in my apartment.”
"#YNH #COVID19 #life #Death #Myth Yet this promise is so fuzzy that even most nationalists do not really know what to make of it. How do you actually “live” in memory? If you are dead, how do you know whether people remember you or not?"
"#YNH #COVID19 #life #Myth The only modern ideology that still awards #Death a central role is nationalism. In its more poetic and desperate moments, nationalism promises that whoever dies for the nation will live forever in its collective memory."
"#YNH #COVID19 #life #Death #Myth Ideologies such as liberalism, socialism &amp; feminism lost interest in afterlife. What happens to a communist capitalist or feminist after he or she dies? It is pointless to look for answer in writings of Karl Marx, Adam Smith or Simone de Beauvoir"
#YNH #COVID19 #Death #Myth Humans have been so successful in attempt to safeguard and prolong #life that our worldview has changed in a profound way. While traditional religions considered the afterlife as the main source of meaning

"#YNH #COVID19 #life #Death #Myth In 17th-century England, about 150 out of every 1,000 newborns died during their first year, and only about 700 made it to age 15. Today, only 5 out of 1,000 English babies die during their first year, and 993 get to celebrate their 15th birthday"
"#YNH #COVID19 #life #Death #Myth Until the 20th century, at least a third of children never reached adulthood. Youngsters routinely succumbed to childhood diseases such as dysentery, measles and smallpox."
"#YNH #COVID19 #life #Death #Myth Over the last two centuries, average life expectancy has jumped from under 40 years to 72 in the entire world, and to more than 80 in some developed countries. Children in particular have succeeded in escaping death’s clutches."
"#YNH #COVID19 #life #Death #Myth Best human minds are investigating microbiological, physiological &amp; genetic systems responsible for disease &amp; old age, &amp; developing new medicines &amp; revolutionary treatments. In their struggle to extend life, humans have been remarkably successful"
"#YNH #COVID19 #life #Death #Myth True, at present we cannot solve all technical problems. But we are working on them. The best human minds no longer spend their time trying to give meaning to death. Instead, they are busy extending life."
"#YNH #COVID19 #life #Death #Myth If the heart flutters, we can stimulate it with a pacemaker or even transplant a new heart. If cancer rampages, we can kill it with radiation. If viruses proliferate in the lungs, we can subdue them with some new medicine."
"#YNH #COVID19 #life #Myth Science believes that every technical problem has a technical solution. Traditionally #Death was the speciality of priests and theologians in black cassocks, now it’s the folks in white lab coats."

#YNH #COVID19 #life #Death #Myth Heart stops pumping blood because not enough oxygen reaches the heart muscle. Cancerous cells spread in the liver because of some chance genetic mutation. Viruses settled in lungs because somebody sneezed on the bus. Nothing metaphysical about it
"#YNH #COVID19 #life #Myth For scientists, #Death isn’t a divine decree – it is merely a technical problem. Humans die not because of some technical glitch. The heart stops pumping blood. Cancer has destroyed the liver. Viruses multiply in the lungs."
#YNH #COVID19 #life #Myth Perhaps someday God would abolish #Death through a grand metaphysical gesture such as Christ’s second coming. But orchestrating such cataclysms was clearly above the pay grade of flesh-and-blood humans. Then came the scientific revolution.
"#YNH #COVID19 #life #Myth For most of history best human minds were busy giving meaning to #Death, not trying to defeat it. Countless sacred books &amp; tales patiently explained that we die because God decreed it or Cosmos, &amp; we had better accept that destiny with humility &amp; grace."
"#YNH #COVID19 #Myth Most religions &amp; ideologies saw #Death not only as inevitable fate but as main source of meaning in #life as after death you come to learn the true secrets of life. Only then did you gain eternal salvation, or suffer everlasting damnation."
