#SavePrisoners_GrantParole As the number of Corona positive cases are increasing alarmingly in jails this indicates the failure of jail administration and state government to ensure the safety of inmates – at Rajasthan
"अवश्य करना चाहिए , Jaipur Jail has become new Corona hotspot, as on May 16, Out of 177 Corona positive cases, 116 are from only Jaipur Jail. In order to prevent spread, Need of the hour is to #SavePrisoners_GrantParole for quarantine purpose. – at Rajasthan"

Corona ko hrana h.. be aware stay safe 
Approximately all jails of India are overloaded with prisoners and all of us knows that crowd & gathering should not be there to stop Corona. So we demand #SavePrisoners_GrantParole
similarly corona has passed but politicians and bureaucracy has not improved then we must pray for Astaghfar
Just for safety government must take step to protect prisoners from spread of Corona Virus. #SavePrisoners_GrantParole @ashokgehlot51
"It is offical that people above age 60 are most likely to get corona. Still being in such critical situation, being above 80 Sant Shri Asharamji Bapu has not given parole. Government should think about it. #SavePrisoners_GrantParole"
It has been observed that corona is spreading in overcrowded places and affecting the older people more. So it's a humble request to the Govt. to grant parole to those prisoners who are falsely alleged and charged. #SavePrisoners_GrantParole
"The corona spreads rapidly! Prisons are dense and unhygienic. Pregnant, Women with children, Cancer patients, Chronic patients, Those who have no risk of escaping, Old age prisoners, Take the necessary precautions and release them! #SavePrisoners_GrantParole"
"Right , It is not at all safe for senior citizen to stay in jail at this corona time. Sant Shri Asharamji Bapu is being senior citizen and above all having diseases has still not given parole. What kind of justice is goverment doing? #SavePrisoners_GrantParole – at Rajasthan"
""" Government has taken an appreciable decision to release prisoners in this critical situation of Corona ! What about 80 years old Sant Shri Asharam Bapuji ? We request quick action on this ! #SavePrisoners_GrantParole @VHPDigital @RSSorg @DN_Thakur_Ji @SureshChavhanke"
"Right sir, Jails may become next epicenter of corona virus as Indian jails are overcrowded . Government must think of freeing people with underlying health issues like Sant Shri Asharamji Bapu #SavePrisoners_GrantParole – at Rajasthan"
"You 110 % right , Corona virus do not check whether person is minister,police,engineer or prisoner. Then why no orders taken on granting parole. #SavePrisoners_GrantParole"
"You right priti ji , ""INDIAN JAILS ARE UNSAFE"" Who shall be held responsible if any prisoner will die in the ""Judicial Custody"" due to Corona? #SavePrisoners_GrantParole"
"Yes pooja ji , Corona has severally affected Jaipur jail. Prisoners too are human beings, they also have right to be safe Govt. must ensure safety of prisoners , incidents like Jaipur must not be repeated. #SavePrisoners_GrantParole – at Rajasthan"
"Yes rupesh sir , Just for safety government must take step to protect prisoners from spread of Corona Virus. #SavePrisoners_GrantParole"
"Corona has severally affected Jaipur jail. Govt. must ensure safety of prisoners , incidents like Jaipur must not be repeated. #SavePrisoners_GrantParole"
Jails may become next epicenter of corona virus as Indian jails are overcrowded . Government must think of freeing people with underlying health issues like Sant Shri Asharamji Bapu #SavePrisoners_GrantParole
Day by day Case's of #Corona increasing to see this Above age of 60 year must release on Parole. That's the Order of High court to give relief from prisoners in infectious condition over the Country. #SavePrisoners_GrantParole
Covid 19 is a pandemic disease and highly infectious disease. In jaipur city Corona patients are increasing very fastly and majority of patients are from central jail. Government must #SavePrisoners_GrantParole
