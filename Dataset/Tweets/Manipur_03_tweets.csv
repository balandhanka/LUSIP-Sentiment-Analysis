You think conducting video conference with SAARC nations is enough to contain the virus? Why did he not do a video conference with all CMs instead? Figures show India has tested the least cases of COVID out of all countries. Remain in denial and face epidemic soon.
This is the worst thing to happen. If doctors get infected then hospitals will get closed in coming days. Why are appropriate safety measures not taken while treating COVID positive patients?
