"Goa Tourism is currently undertaking a survey to identify the needs of the tourism industry in the wave of the Corona virus crisis. If you work in the tourism sector in Goa, share your issues, concerns and ideas. To participate click on the link: http://goa-tourism.com/covid19survey"
Predictions to estimate when the #covid19 pandemic might end based on data provided by @sutdsg. Map prepared on @transerve Online Stack. #lockdown #corona #lockdown2020 https://tinyurl.com/ybk49x6b
Corona has impacted our psyche and we now long for hitherto mundane chores. Taught us to value whatever we have
The government should seriously think about creating corona areas where these covidiots can be packed off to. Whoever doesn't care about his own well being can go there. This way care can be taken of who needs it and general public can be saved.
Save them from corona
Hope you can pull the state out of this imminent corona disaster
Good to see movies so that you can get rid of corona for some time from the mind
Corona has taught people what even parents could not do
How about the people stranded here in Goa. Hundreds are stranded here. I think this is the right time to evacuate people from here as Goa is a corona free state as of now.

Corona has taught many people many things. Change of proffessions should be a serious option
How about the hundreds of people stranded here in Goa. Being a corona free state I think the government should try to evacuate the people of UT ASAP.
@goacm @prudentgoa @GoaPlusNews @SmtJMOfficial Wts happening in Goa. I can see ppl roaming freely in Taleigao. Are we inviting trouble of Corona again..
Very well said. These are corona times and strange things are happening.
"Yes Kerala, Mumbai municipal commissioner, the bhilwara magician. In fact I have suggested a corona ministry"
Employment should be the first item on post corona agenda of every government. Please divert all your efforts to that direction
Corona does not spare any one
The theory that corona is less effective in hot and humid climate still holds. It is not mutating as fast as it was feared to. 94 percent cases are in countries with temperatures less than 17degree
There are countless stories in this country of brave people who showed exemplary spirit and guts in this fight against corona. Unfortunately they will all be forgotten moment we come out of this
Request the media to publish the daily downloads of Aarogya setu App and create a frenzy around it in the country. Involve celebrities as well. This can be a game changer in the fight against corona post lock down

Q: Who declared Corona as a pandemic? A: WHO declared Corona as a pandemic.
"This Corona issue will go as like others. As PM, Modi has said to the Sarpanchs of the country that this is the time where we should make ourselves independent. This is the time where we should make a new model of development. #SanghKiBaat"
Do you mean they did no wrong. Or that they were responsible for spreading corona all over the country. If they had cooperated at that time this countrys infection rate would have been far lower. Please don't try to make heroes out of villains. @Siddhes25409182
@vijayanpinarayi @shailajateacher One is very clear CM and Health Minister is doing a excellent job which is bench mark to other States.Opposing Kerala Govt during this Covid 19 crisis with other issues is not a good idea.opposition should work for people to prevent Corona
Corona has upturned all theories.
He him self is a form of corona 
"It is hogwash. Moment we come out of corona china will arm twist and status quo will continue. India to become a global manufacturing hub has to create the right eco system. Archaic labour laws, land acquisition, poor electricity, uncertain tax regime etc. Hundreds of problems"
He has probably the finest mind in this government. He should have been put at the forefront in the fight against corona. If not atleast he should be given charge of the re-opening and I am sure he will bring the economy back on track. The best techno politician of India
"Hey Hey Trying to stay safe at work even though our nincompoop CM declared Goa corona free. Then again, maybe he was talking about the beer "
"There is a definite pattern emerging. The danger is now restricted to the few hotspots in places like Mumbai, Delhi, Gujarat etc. Most of India is emerging out of the corona shadow."
"China and Bengal communists, both affected by corona, ruled by strong leaders. Any other similarities?"
"Dear sir, you are one of the best economists of this country. Don't you think every penny saved today can be diverted to the fight against corona"
Lawyers are still not accustomed to the new normal imposed on us by corona. Please give them some time
You can never expect any truth from Beijing let alone corona
Government missed the bus in terms of de destigmatizing corona patients. Now this will be another menace as more and more ostracization cases surface
"This is #Chennai. Guys without mask were put inside an ambulance, which had a dummy Corona infected patient. They learnt the best lesson for violating the Lockdown #IndiaFightsCorona"
Slowly the time is coming where we can say about 60percent India is corona free
Maulana Saadh is a criminal and a proven terrorist who has tried to spread Corona in our country by planting Human Corona Bombs through Jamatis. He is a national criminal n should be treated like Kasab was treated. U rightly said Deepak ji.... Maulana Saadh is CORONA MAULA
You are the torch bearer in this fight. Suggest that central government form a corona ministry and give you the charge. The whole country will benefit. @sardesairajdeep @BDUTT @ndtv @PrannoyRoyNDTV @rahulkanwal @MickyGupta84
@ndtv This tabligh nonsense is growing by the day. Had they to do anything like this in a Islamic country they would have been packed off probably never to be seen again. We have given them s long rope to our detriment . We should have corona zones to put people who don't abidr
"3 corona suspects put in GMC isolation ward,34 in facility quarantine.75 reports came negative,46 reports awaited.3 cured patients home quarantined. The fight is not yet over. Don't let your Guard Down! #stayhomestaysafe #Lockdown2 #wefollowsocialdistancing #GoaFightsCOVID19 – at Aquem"
Corona virus is a hoax! Lift the lock down and get on with life. The emperor needs the lock down as an excuse for his economic incompetence! 
The government should lift the lock down and end the misery of the common man. The Corona virus is like that uninvited guest who will be with us for a long time to come. We know that the BJP government wants to hide its economic failures buy giving us the Corona scare! 
@CMO_Odisha WB is a corona time bomb. Please seal the border of that state with military tightness.
The same ordinance should also cover police on corona duty. Police should be given free to shoot order in self defence.
Rumour is always dangerous. The death of Goan Congress leader Jitendra DESHPRABHU is in question that whether he died through Pneumonia or Corona! Salute to dynamic health Minister who clarified immediately that it was not Corona. @visrane #goacm#bjp

"While we support our govt in giving medical treatment to tableeghis who are responsible for 30% Corona cases in India; we also await the justice to Sadhus killed in mob lynching amid mistaken identity. Makes me wonder ""Hum Santon ke saath hai ya Shaitano ke?"" #SantonKeSaathDesh"
Is it so important ! When the health ministry is updating us every day in PC !! Delegation is the key ! Without daily press conference he has managed to put India on top priority against corona and has been successful in it! #pmhaijaadoogarnahi
Goa becomes India’s first Corona free state. 
@sardesairajdeep As per statistics available 94per cent of the corona cases are in countries with less than 17degree temperature. When asked Dr guleria agreed with a caveat. The virus may b spreading indoors wher temps r low. Can't a study b done abt our cases whether they are in
Since Kerala is doing so well in the fight against corona the centre should not have interfered in their lockdown relaxation. If successful that also could have become a template for other states to follow. Request MHA to rethink.

@DrPramodPSawant @goacm @visrane Although it's tough to control the spread of a virus like Corona the team has done a good job. I am unsure why all the 40MLA are not working baring a few Get these guys working checking with the people if all is well.
