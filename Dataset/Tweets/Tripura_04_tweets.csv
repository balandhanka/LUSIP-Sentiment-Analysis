Some say Terrorism has no religion. Ok. I accept that. But i want to know who are those bastards who pelted stones on our Corona Warriors? Why Police are afraid of entering some specific areas? These are those people who wants INDIA to loose in this War against Corona Virus.
More dangerous then Corona Virus itself. They just know how to break the backbone of a human so that their working mentality gets damaged which they did for last 25 years in Tripura. Cpim damaged the work culture here. People now doesn't want to work.
I don't see so called Humanists and messengers of peace and love. Secular soldiers protest or condem against the brutal murder & lynching of sadhus in Maharashtra and also ill treatment faced by religious minorities in Pakistan due to corona. This again exposes their hypocrisy.

China is crossing all limits. At one side they are spreading Covid-19 and locking up the World and they are now raising the Kashmir issue at UNSC. And on other side Pakistan is sending terrorists in Kashmir. This is Shame! Shame! at all. @sudhirchaudhary @narendramodi @AmitShah
