If there was a vaccine available to fight #COVID19 would you choose not to take it just as you are choosing not to #sociallydistance yourself cuz you think your young and fit body can fight it? #DontBeStupidAlready #StayHome

"https://www.lbc.co.uk/hot-topics/coronavirus/why-uk-acting-differently-other-countries/ This is on a bizarre assumption that unlike all the other Pandemics like Swine Flu, Spanish Flu, SARS, MERS, etc, #COVID19 will have a double peak! Where’s the evidence? None...except that it will cause death to most vulnerable people&amp; #NHS may survive."
Remote work and distance learning should be taken seriously. #COVID19 #CoronaOutbreak
Motion sensor handwash dispenser.. Need of the hour.. #Covid_19

Good time to complete writing and skype interviews due to travel ban and cancelled conferences #COVID19 #Academic

"To fight the CoVID19,Goa International Airport is taking utmost care and the regular fumigation is carried for Immigration/screening counters, washrooms,offices in International arrival. NO STONE IS LEFT UNTURNED @AAI_Official @MoCA_GoI @MoHFW_INDIA @DGCAIndia @visrane @aairedwr – at Dabolim Goa International Airport (GOI)"
I think China should be billed for the spread of Covid19 as they tried to hide the fact. Protecting the communist party at the cost of the world health isn't acceptable. The Chinese govt should be docked in the UN and by affected govt's.
