Because no one listening Ravish bhakwas. He is not not giving any useful news only accusations. Why he is not giving CORONA news.
communists have shown their untouchability during the fight against corona by lynching 70 year old sadhu. Now she is expressing solidarity with the murderers. 
Corona time not corrola time keep cool as it is Raj.All should pray united india
"He touched the main switch which brought down power supply to partner government. NCP is smiling, SS also not affected. BJP is worrying because they don't want any government now. CORONA sidelined. Only Sadhus shaken all."
How can they arrest that men it's his wish from whom he can take delivery and nowadays these peacefuls intentionally spreading corona so anyone can deny.

@RahulGandhi give your idea to save country from corona .Do not criticise other this time .this is the main reason that people is ignoring you
Have you sent an open letter to Tabligi Jamat to desist from spreading corona. Muslims are hell bent to spread the virus and make India miserable. Your community is a curse upon the country and we are cursed to live with people like you.
That case of a tiger catching corona virus proves that humans and tigers seem to be similar on their genetic traits 
@ShekharGupta is a Modi hater so nothing good can be accepted from this presstitute. If this intellectual has some guts he should ask Tabligi jamat and its follower muslims to behave and desist from spreading corona. Idiot.
May be Corona took many things from life but also added and showed a lot of things to people too #GoodMorning 
When we get medicine against corona virus?
She's killing it with her hinduphobic anti government ranting. When the world is still reeling under corona she feels it's okay to spread fear and hatred under the name of trying to spread information that the govt is conspiring against its own government.

Proper isolation is the only thing that we can do to stop the spread of corona !!! So why not bail or parol to old aged people ???!!! #SafetyFromCoronaToPrisoners
This is very clear that Corona is more dangerous for Senior Citizens who have more than 60 years of age. So extra precautions are required for them. That's why we demand release of 84+ years saint - Sant Shri Asharamji Bapu. #SafetyFromCoronaToPrisoners
"In India corona has spread to 30%of Indian districts , local authorities must have the preparedness , strengthen healthcare system and surveillance! "
Will that reduce Corona crisis?
If any single person suffers from corona then other healthy persons will also get affected !!! So #SafetyFromCoronaToPrisoners is MUST !!!
Old aged people need some special care and isolation so they cannot be affected by corona ! And everyone has rights to stay healthy ! #SafetyFromCoronaToPrisoners
As everyone knows that corona easily affects older people so its very necessary to care for them !! #SafetyFromCoronaToPrisoners
Every person needs to be isolated if we want to stop the spread of corona !! #SafetyFromCoronaToPrisoners
"Corona does affect older people easily, so isolation for them is very necessary!! Even if they are in prison!!!! #SafetyFromCoronaToPrisoners"

Nizamuddin markaz attendees have become Corona bomb and are spreading virus disease across India.Maulana Saad of Markaz have appealed to Muslims to defy lockdown and gather in mosques to offer namaz.
"If this will go on, people will die of hunger rather than of Corona virus. Mere lockdown is not enough. The relevant issues should also be solved. ---J.H.Bhatt, Vadodara."
It's very compalsury for this noval Corona virus so please take action this places thanks for your regards

"#CoronaRiskForPrisoners who is imprisoned for 6 years despite being innocent. TV personalities like Imam Bukhari, Salman Khan, Tarun Tejpal and many more got bail. So why an 85 year old Hindu saint is not released even when the danger of Corona is high in elderly people."
"Distance means so little, when life means so much.Defeat Corona Virus with social distancing. follow it and Break Chain. #StaySafe #StayHome #Corona #Socialdistancing #vadodara #essenceaestehticclinic #india."
"CM sir, please look at this matter also... This type of matter is also very dangerous disease like corona. Eating whole society slowly and slowly.... "
Sermons of Tablighi jamaat of Nizamuddin markaz is like Osama bin Laden and Baghdadi who want to utilise Corona pandemic to destabilize India by causing mass deaths.
It's not about Hindu or Muslim. It is about fundamental Maulanas who are plunging country into Corona epidemic.
"Guys, today the whole world is going through a very big crisis. And no country is untouched by this crisis. The corona virus is such a serious problem that very few people know its severity. As shown in this photo,… https://www.instagram.com/p/B-KnJqFAAtc/?igshid=1iiq28xoz2czi"
"Prisoners are staying in numbers in prison and are exposed to the threat of Corona Virus. Their family members can't take care of them and police, too, engaged in various activities, nowadays, are helpless. Only course left is to give them parole. #CoronaRiskForPrisoners"
Jamaat hiding corona infected &amp; spread it from J&amp;K to Andaman &amp; from Rajasthan to Manipur through these infected many ppls arrested from Vrindavan as media reports show their ill intention their motive is to spread corona to sabotage Govt's Lock down it's a hilarious crime 
Sad to say failure of police & intelligence in the case of Tablighi Jamaat if corona spread in Delhi &amp; situation worsened on that then administration must responsible with this Jamaat better late than never now act strictly &amp; not only quarantine but all culprits must be in jail
Nizamuddin markaz appears to be a sinister design to plunge country into Corona crisis. Nizamuddin markaz Maulana said Lockdown is against Muslims.
Çongress supporting Nizamuddin markaz which plunged the country into Corona crisis is deplorable.
Health workers looking for Nizamuddin markaz attendees beaten up in Ahmednagar Maharashtra. Nizamuddin markaz appears to be a sinister design to plunge country into Corona crisis.
Due to china voiras world is dengar. Because china make biological voiras. @UN @realDonaldTrump @POTUS @narendramodi should action against corona voiras on China. 
@khanumarfa Remember not Majority it's Mullah's Maulvi only defying with nation. It's only muslim community not yet hs xome frwrd 4 financial support . If majority poor labourers r stranded then only Hindus across d globe extending millions of fund. labourers r nt spitting Corona
"They will die but Will not spread Corona purposely like your fellows, worry about them"
"Story of corona positive male nurse,u shd talk to him @ChouhanShivraj"
It is because of Modi that nation is fighting corona and not yet surrendered to it.
@Kumkum26 nice coverage on corona by u n sbp
"Yes. I agree with you. As per WHO reports, Corona Virus is dangerous for old aged people. Risk to their lives is more than comparison to others. Due to #CoronaRiskForPrisoners old aged prisoners like 84 years old Sant Shri Asharamji Bapu should be released on bail/parole ASAP."
How shamelessly some people defending Nizamuddin markaz which led to the outbreak of disease and landed India into Corona crisis inspite of repeated government warnings. Is this not Jihadi journalism.
Is there any other country in the world where a particular religious group think that they are above nation and its constitution & violate all restrictions set up by the government to show that corona is a divisive agenda of government?
"There are more than 10 or 20 inmates in the jail, and the majority of the corona spread remains the same where the crowd is more crowded because this virus is more prone to chain reaction. #CoronaRiskForPrisoners"
Please send me a link or information if in any secular and democratic country 3000 people collected for religious function in March after the outbreak of Corona pandemic.
"#CoronaRiskForPrisoners why innocent Sant Shri Asharamji Bapu who has been framed by anti social forces who want to defame hindus, so it's humble request to Govt. to give parole under current situation of corona epidemic."
Around 3000 prisoners to be released from Delhi jails because Corona infection suspects are also present in prisons. #CoronaRiskForPrisoners as he is an elderly saint and should not be kept in jail at risk https://www.livehindustan.com/national/story-coronavirus-delhi-3-jail-including-tihar-release-3000-prisons-3104433.html

"Fact is that India is lacking COVID19 testing kits and hence developing her own guidelines, but this will not help in containment of pandemic."
Incubation time of COVID19 virus is on an average 5 days &amp; symptoms are visible only after that. Further pls note that WHO has urged countries to test as many people as possible to curb the pandemic.
