"Arresting the great grand son-in-law of Dr. B.R. Ambedkar on the birth anniversary of Dr. B.R. Ambedkar tell you a lot about where we are headed as a society. We are sick not just from #COVID19 but from casteism, communalism and authoritarianism! #DoNotArrestAnand"
GOI India invests huge amount on promotional activities... But unfortunately few of leaders /ministers are actually active in awaring people on prevention and control of COVID19.. We don't know what is source of fund for IT cells operations ?? All rules for middle-class..

@rahulkanwal when are you planning to do an investigation against your bosses in the govt for not doing enough testing of COVID19? Is your spine straight? #PehleHealthCare
"Even earlier, we had hunger related deaths. Things have gotten worse since lockdown. Malnourished bodies are less immune to disease, including #COVID19. We can't fight against COVID19 without also fighting against hunger. #PehleHealthCare #भूख_मिटाओ_कोरोना_भगाओ"
"NaMo's legacy in public health as Gujarat CM Gujarat spent 4.39% of state expend on health in 1999. By 2009 this came down to 0.77%. Result: Lack of hospital beds, ventillators & ICUs. Consequence: Highest fatality rate in COVID19. #PehleHealthCare"
Gujarat has seen the highest fatality rate amongst COVID19 affected patients (7.88% as opposed to 2.87% for India as a whole). The public health system of Gujarat which is lying in shambles is one of the main reasons behind this. Please #PehleHealthCare https://thewire.in/politics/gujarat-model-narendra-modi-covid-19/amp/?__twitter_impression=true
"The pandemic has revealed the inadequacies of a privatized healthcare system in dealing with crisis. The biggest example of this is the USA, which is having a tough time. On the other hand, a communist Cuba is actively helping even other countries fight COVID19! #PehleHealthCare"
"Hey @RubikaLiyaquat, when was the last time before COVID19 that you discussed public health? India faces an estimated shortage of 160,000 hospital beds. Govt spends only 1.3% of GDP on health. Media is supposed to raise these issues, but you never did. Shame on u #PehleHealthCare"
Mr. @rahulkanwal tum to bade besharam nikle. You are the most slimy propagandist for BJP and its hate politics. India had its first COVID19 positve case on 30th Jan. Will you ever ask the govt what it was doing in Feb and half of March? #PehleHealthCare
The media keeps calling communists anti-national. But how is communist ruled Kerala a model state in dealing with #COVID19. Answer lies not just in emergency relief measures but in its robust health system. Anti-nationals are those who neglect public health. #PehleHealthCare
"Before the COVID19 stuck, when was the last time you saw the Godi media do a debate on the health system in India? These channels are truly anti-national. #PehleHealthCare"
"It seems that the lockdown is going to be extended. 3 weeks of lockdown & we haven't been able to flatten the curve. One reason for that is that we haven't been testing enough. Along with lockdown, the key to fighting COVID19 remains Test, Test, Test. #PehleHealthCare"
"Countries, like Germany, with a robust public health system have tackled COVID19 effectively. Even in India, the state of Kerala stands out because of its better public health system, sustained by an overall high govt spending in this sector. Any lessons here? #PehleHealthCare"
Some one saying in UK COVID19 BY ESCON ITS RIGHT OR WRONG 
Hope for the best. Will WTO allow this to happen? Once WHO indirectly supported China on Covid19 then it seems impossible for Japanese to get out of China.

@RubikaLiyaquat @AMISHDEVGAN @DChaurasia2312 Ain't this making you proud? Afterall you achieved what you wanted. Your communal reporting and hate has led to this. You are turning Delhi into a chaotic land. #Covid_19 
Hi @ArvindKejriwal @LtGovDelhi @DelhiPolice i would like to know if any action will be taken against these people or now its okay to do so? 1. They are gathering for a meeting openly during the lockdown period. 2.They are calling for open discrimination against Muslims. #Covid_19

"Germany is doing 350,000 tests per week. Among other reasons, it's also one why its death rate is as low as 1.4 percent, while Italy, Spain, France, Britain all have more than 10% India needs to test more, only way to get over this nightmare soon. #TestKaroNa #COVID19"

"60% of all COVID19 positive cases are linked to Tablighi Jamat. But isn't this because they have been tested, whereas the overall testing is very little. Test more, and you will realise the real picture is very different. #TestKaroNa"
"The PM thinks of the people as sheep, who can be herded in any direction. The docs are facing a shortage of safety gear. The country has one of the lowest number of testing for #COVID19. And he wants us one day to clap &amp; another day to light candles. Wake up, India. #TestKaroNa"
"With the kind of density of population in India, specially in pockets where poor reside, there is an urgent need for mass testing. The Dharavi casualty due to #COVID19 should be an eye opener. #TestKaroNa"
Appeal to the media: Please stop acting as Modi's personal PR machine. Ask the right questions. Such as: 1) Why is there lack for protective gear for our healthcare workers? 2) Why are there so few #COVID19 tests? It is a test of your love for India. #TestKaroNa
"Central Govt must consider number of Covid19 cases &amp; hotspots to decide allocation of State Disaster Risk Management Fund to states Under the current scheme states like Delhi, Kerala &amp; Punjab have a large number of positive cases but are receiving very little funds from SDRMF"
Most of our media is not interested in raising substantive questions regarding our response to COVID19. They are interested in praising their supreme leader or communalizing the pandemic. It is left to citizens to ask why is their lack of gear for docs &amp; so few tests? #TestKaroNa
"Rather than acting as Modi's personal PR firm for his antics, is it not the responsibility of our TV news channels to ask the govt why are there so few tests for #COVID19? #TestKaroNa"
Maharashtra and Kerala have recorded the most number of people tested positive for #COVID19. Is it a coincidence that these are also the states which have had the highest number of tests? We will never know the real picture unless we test enough people. #TestKaroNa
"A doctor on a TV debate said that the official numbers of number of people tested positive for #COVID19 reveals only the tip of the iceberg. We aren't testing enough people, so we don't know the real picture. India has one of the lowest numbers of tests in the world. #TestKaroNa"

In this Frame NSA is shaking hand with Maulana Saad and without maintaining social distancing. Gross violation of Govt Order in vogue. He should also be kept in Quarantine because Maulana Saad might be infected with Covid19.
