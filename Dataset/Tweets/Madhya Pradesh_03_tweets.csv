@sardesairajdeep their fundamentals are more stubborn. They are ready to die of corona instead of living with CAA. It also proves that it wasn’t much politically motivated. 
Corona lockdown request in m.p. It's my humble request to m.p. government that like other states please declare lockdown in m.p. also to break the chain of spreading till 31st March. As the cases are rising specially in tribal areas. Please declare lockdown in m.p. also.
Let's see guys lots of people in rural areas are also aware about corona virus in fact Gangour programs is also cancel in many villages.
