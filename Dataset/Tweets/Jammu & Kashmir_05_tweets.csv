This is insane. Yesterday some persons ransacked a portion of Peshawar Lady Reading Hospital when their female relative died. They claimed she was well but put in Corona ward.
Reminder that a PTI governor & PTI MPA from this same city have been calling covid-19 a flu & measures to control it a conspiracy against Karachi for weeks. Imran Ismail & Khurram Sherzaman have both recklessly fanned corona conspiracies. They are directly responsible for this.
