Sir..; There are more than 10 or 20 inmates in a jail cell and the majority of the corona infections occur where the crowd is more because this virus is more prone to chain reaction. #CoronaRiskInJail
"Today, while talking about social distance, prisoners in the prison are becoming Corona positive, which has more elderly prisoners, so the government should release the elderly prisoners on parole. #CoronaRiskInJail"
There are more danger and risk of corona in prison. Because there is neither cleanliness nor there is social distancing obeyed. So there is a high risk to spread corona in prison. #CoronaRiskInJail

WHO says that those persons above the age of 60 years are exposed to Corona Virus. Sant Shri Asharamji Bapu Ji is more than 80 years of age. It is proposed to release him on parole urgently. #SavePrisoners_GrantParole
"The older people who are innocent and still kept in jail under conspiracy like Sant Shri Asharamji Bapu, Govt .Should take immediate action and release him. As people above 60 years have high risk for getting infection of corona. #SavePrisoners_GrantParole"
"Elderly inmates in prisons are at greater risk of corona infection. In such a situation, the central and state governments are requested to take prompt action to release the elderly prisoners on parole as a safety measure. #SavePrisoners_GrantParole"
#SavePrisoners_GrantParole As the number of Corona positive cases are increasing alarmingly in jails this indicates the failure of jail administration and state government to ensure the safety of inmates 
"Corona has also infiltrated detainees across the country, which is a matter of great concern. Prison administration can also ease its responsibility by #SavePrisoners_GrantParole who are at greater risk like elderly prisoners."

Recently 5 prisoners have been found corona positive in MP. Government should take this into consideration and ensure the safety of prisoners. #SavePrisoners_GrantParole
"Prisons can easily become Corona hotspots because: Closed n Congested environment, no proper ventilation Elderly people have less immunity n already ill, so more prone to infections Due to lack of space, social distancing is impossible Hence, to #SavePrisoners_GrantParole !"
"Mumbai has become the capital of Corona in the country. In Arthur Road jail as well as central jail, hundreds of prisoners are found Corona positive. In order to save their lives, Jail authorities should #SavePrisoners_GrantParole for quarantine purpose."
Jaipur jail has become the 3rd biggest Corona Hotspot Govt. must grant parole to prisoners for their safety. #SavePrisoners_GrantParole
"The corona spreads rapidly! Prisons are dense and unhygienic. Pregnant, Women with children, Cancer patients, Chronic patients, Those who have no risk of escaping, Old age prisoners, Take the necessary precautions and release them #SavePrisoners_GrantParole"
"""INDIAN JAILS ARE UNSAFE"" Who shall be held responsible if any prisoner will die in the ""Judicial Custody"" due to Corona #SavePrisoners_GrantParole"
If any prisoners get corona positive in jail. Who will be responsible for their Life. Sant Shri Asharamji Bapu is kept in jail without any Proved Evidence. So it's the duty of Rajasthan govt. To release immediately to Innocent Hindu Saint. #SavePrisoners_GrantParole
"Chaman ji,,Jails may become next epicenter of corona virus as Indian jails are overcrowded . Government must think of freeing people with underlying health issues like Sant Shri Asharamji Bapu #SavePrisoners_GrantParole"

"Sir I said one month for each corona warrior not doctors or para medical. I included Police , Municipality and all drivers."
Special consideration was given for or sikh pilgrimage from Nanded to Amritsar during lockdown period. why this was done? and who is responsible for this? is it because of same party ruling for both the states? it has infected more than 1000 corona positive. India wants to know.

Indian #AirForceSalutes corona warriors. But was it required ? Huge Money spent on such big event ? Why Govt asks public to donate then? Wastage of money in times of economic crisis. This Govt manages event in a best way. PM Cares funding &amp; utilization must be audited.

Yes community spread is on pan India. To know the death due to COVID19 alone count the comorbidities out. Else it is a scam if all cause (excluding covid) mortality is down because everything now is reclassified as COVID19 death. Something 2 do with grants per case in US?

But Dr Dosi has and I am from Indore. I was pissed when I was refused COVID19 testing despite ticking 9/10 checkboxes. Survived the hell and perhaps immune for life now. Same for son too. 
I am not a big fan of Mamta. But she was right in not classifying comorbidities death as COVID19 death but surrendered finally?. Why this is being done globally? Sounds more like a scam to me so as to create a fear factor so that governments find it easier to control subjects.
Stop comparing with Wuhan as China nos are alm fudged. Where's the ICMR data on HCQS on Dharavi? People will die. To save 5% (or 0.5% on total population) I don't think it would be wise to screw 99.5%. Step 1: stop calling all death as COVID19 death. Separate comorbidities out.
