#Cuba gives permission for cruise ship carrying #COVID19 patients to dock citing solidarity and health as a #HumanRights
In #India govt takes full responsibility of quarantine &amp; treatment of #COVID19. In western countries the treatment is not free and very costly. Most of the infected people sit at home without medication. This is the reason for high death rates in #Italy and #USA @ImtiazMadmood

.The world will remember 2020 by the way #Covid19 moved #Touch to #Touché @ForHumanstoKnow
@ForHumanstoKnow interesting that humans have already created #tags for #covid19 by country even after @UN @WHO has declared it a #pandemic - #knowledge does not always translate to #learning or action 
.Bingo the best opportunity we’ve had in times when #wars and #walls are being #branded by a #design via political #influencers using advanced lessons from #marketing and #behaviour science. This friend of mine thinks so https://youtu.be/i-r8e6jv47k @ForHumanstoKnow #Covid19
".Let’s hope and #pray (since we are #human) the #Covid19 will catalyse #humanity’s quest to #collaborate across man made borders - and can be a blessing in disguise which will help @ForHumanstoKnow value of #connections beyond #religion, nation race https://youtu.be/i-r8e6jv47k"
"And that's how powerful a virus is! There is a marked difference in how people are greeting each other. It's a time of concern, a time to think, a time to change. Let's hope that change is for good. #Corona #COVID19 "
"If only @Govtofkerala would pursue flood rehab, rightful fund allocation to victims with the same fervour as it's doing in the case of tackling a pandemic like #COVID19. Unfortunately, that's not happening. My take in @moneycontrolcom"
Govt.of India to send a medical team to Italy to support Indians says @MOS_MEA #COVID19 #coronavirusindia #Coronaitaly
Now Iran is saying that #COVID19 is a manufactured global biological weapon. If this gets proved without a doubt then we are in for a really bad case of global political drama unfolding. 
The markets are in a free fall across the world. Only time will let us see in hindsight if this was the beginning of the new economic recession. #COVID19
3 people came to Kerala for holiday. And entire Kerala got holiday! #COVID19
It's a right advice but too early to act on. It will yield only if done after the #COVID19 scare is subsided.
3 people travelled from #Italy to #Kerala. They had #COVID19 . They skipped the airport health check and never told anybody. They attended functions. Now hundreds of people are getting monitored. Govt should take case against the 3 carriers for putting others life under risk.
This is one the best advisory I saw on #COVID19 . It removes the scare a lot. 
Even living gods and saints are scared of #COVID19
