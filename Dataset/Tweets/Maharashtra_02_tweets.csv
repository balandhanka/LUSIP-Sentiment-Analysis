You are fool. none of the Chinese who died because of Corona virus were Muslims. In fact China is officially torturing Muslims for their religion. Yes Muslims eat non vegetarian food but they only eat that food which Allah has permitted so they are safe.
"What does Rahul Gandhi expects Modi to do to guard against corona virus? Dance on the street of Wuhan? What more does he expects, he evacuated every indian from Wuhan, ensured that every person coming from China is screened for virus, isolated patients suspected for virus. MY GOD"

It is shown in the media that Chinese govt. has asked its supreme court to allow them to kill twenty thousand people contacted with Corona virus. Doesn't mean that these people do not have the right time live? People from Human rights should interfere in the matter.
Xi Jinping first announced to the world that Corona Virus was a serious global risk. Also he appears on Chinese TV to reassure people. We don’t see this as our TV debates are full of CAA/NRC/ Shaheenbagh. He also met many WHO delegation that have visited China.
