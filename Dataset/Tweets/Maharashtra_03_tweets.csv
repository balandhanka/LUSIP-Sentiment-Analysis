U do realise that it was the right decision to lock down without notice since there were only 2 deaths due to corona. We were able to restrict the spread by a substantial amount. Many more would have died due to corona spread.

@OfficeofUT @rajeshtope11 @CMOMaharashtra Sir please look into this matter.Public of Jalgaon city is suffering because doctors are afraid of corona virus.. hospitals are sending patients back by telling them that they're closed for general OPD due to corona outbreak.
Bank employees are at greater risk to Corona Virus pandemic after health sector. It is well known that they are low paid considering duties+risk involved. They only carried out all tough govt decisions. It doesn’t look good to know that their wage revision is due since Nov 2017. 
@PMOIndia why don’t we use funds lies with religious bodies and so called spiritual gurus to fight for Corona Virus rather than asking people to donate. We have lakhs of crore lying in temples / Churches / mosque and entities like @Iskon. They should donate the required funds

I see a universal rejection of negative tweets. People who were otherwise staunch supporters of one party/ideology aren't amused at a cynical spokesperson. Corona has united us while distancing us socially. How ironic! #BreakTheChain #FlattenTheCurve #StayHomeIndia #KillCorona
"Govt has not put any restrictions on Private hospitals,but some Private Coeporate Hospitals in Hyderabad have stopped/ closed OP (Out Patient) services taking Corona Virus as excuse.Many out patients also have severe problems @TelanganaCMO @EtelaRajenderHealth Health Minister"
Good luck on this auspicious day that everyone will have get a healthy life in the face of the world's Corona viruse crisis. #coronavirus #covid19 #stayhomestaysafe #workfromhome #corona #happynewyear #gudhipadva #vanashreefoodindustry
"I want assure all my fellow citizens that the guidelines for MH stays as is. All the essential services & goods will be available. I appeal to the people to not panic or be confused, the MH Govt. is with you. Plz do not gather on the streets or in shops. @CMOMaharashtra #Corona"
"Sir,We are committed to your Administration in fighting Corona. https://twitter.com/news24tvchannel/status/1242645053194924034"
@AmitShah @narendramodi Corona virus and Pollution both will be in control . So I request to all Bharat wasi to stay in home for WAR against COVID-19 and POLLUTION too. 
Salute to all Doctors and nurses who have fight against corona virus #CoronavirusLockdown – at GIDC Ankleshwar
We stopped newspapers since last 5 days voluntarily. Those also could be a potential carrier of the corona virus. We are catching up on all the news digitally. Unfortunately the irony is that the home wifi as suddenly dropped down the speed perhaps 1/10th. Too much load perhaps
"I also do Fast every Navratri. A resolution for this Navratri is, Prayers for people who’re struggling with their life due to this Killer Corona and good health for every living creature on our planet. "
Mr Tharoor news papers are the biggest source of spreading corona as it exchanges many hands right from printing to distribution to redistribution. I thought you'd know that. And essential shops are all open. Use ur brain.
This on this new year Ugadi let's us follow 'Koi Road par Na Nikle' to lay the road for Corona free India. #IndiaFightsCorona #21daylockdown – at Hyderabad
We stand by you and rest of the citizens of world in our fight against Corona. Simple battle requires the people to be at home. 
Market is all about perception. First you try to catch the knife and then throw the the us simulas will work once corona is in control. Like in case of China.We may not outperform as we don't have a government which understand economics but we will get some rub off.
"I am a freelancer and someone wanted me to go to their office last week for a meeting. When I refused the boss comes online and asks me - ""what are seriously scared of Corona virus? You think you will get it? You think it is a new virus and never existed before?"""
This situation is so dangerous that better people are safe at one place. We know one Chinese lady passed Corona to 5000 people. Indian government is taking good decisions to help us only. Better we follow them strictly. No other option we have now.
"@PuneCityPolice Hi Team, I just want to inform about the misconduct happening in my own house. My flatmate is a gym trainer and he goes to trains them now too. May be he is totally immune to corona but I may catch corona because of his frequent visits outside the house. Thanks – at Veerabhadra Nagar"
"Sr citizens are in different league. Come corona or go corona,they will wrap a tiny handkerchief and start their morning walk. Kaka ,your immunity is waning why take panga with #coronavirus . Udd jaayoge"
"Standing in a que for ATMs to tatkal-ish ques for supermarkets. If there's anything life's teaching, it's to reframe the mundane things like joys of life. Demon to Corona."

"Modiji, Don't be in a hurry 2 announce any package. In any case, 21 days are locked out. No benefit from any announcements now. Open a interactive website where every concerned citizen can make suggestions. Announce package on 15th April only after accessing damage due 2 Corona"
"Why not? if a terrorist like corona is moving on the road, 3 weeks does not matter. you also stay at home so virus will not speed because of you. Moron. "
21 days of House arrest to defeat Corona Virus 
Richa he is being proved correct. There could means ways instead of complete nation closed down. Only importers of of corona were needed to be isolated but now we hv to accept an avoidable surgery very high cost surgery.
"@TSConsumers @KTRTRS hello team due to the Whole india lockdown for Corona all RTA Ofcs will be close ,, what about already slots booked or exp date of licence between these days, bcz my learning licence going to expire on 12 April,Online renwal process is not wrkng, pls do ndful"

Corona Virus was developed by China to control world's economy. Sooner or later world will realise this and then China will pay for its SINS.

"As per mathemetics if correct 100% need corona test? 2nd it's free in Govt Labs , also max cap is of 4500. Chalo jane do !"
Sir plz do something about loan repayment and emi extensions. Small businesses are already affected due to Global slow down and now Corona has hit us really very hard. Income is variable but managing fixed expense with such lock down is quiet a pain. Hope will get some tax-relief 
"Dear Sir, please extend the emi payments for common people. Business slow down affected our work since December and now it’s Corona. For small businesses to survive we need rotational money too. Burden of taxes is still lesser and is based on income but emi expenses are stable."
Let's pray for Peace and Harmony for our country during such taxing times in the coming year on this day. Wish you a very Happy Gudi Padwa 2020! #gudipadwa #corona #covid19 #india

@PChidambaram_IN: Feeling mixed emotions. Happiness and relief at expert advice that a complete lockdown is the only way to battle Corona. Frustration that people are still traveling. The government should have announced substantial relief to the poor.
"@KTRTRS Sir, the govt. should have given one/two days time for non-locals to travel back to their native places. We are worried about our livelihood until 31 March and furthermore. Please consider our situation and let us go back to our native places if we are free from Corona."
If corona virus doesn’t kill us this lockdown will. No clear idea how to get daily supplies. Today bread egg shop closed. Meat shop closed. Only one grocery store open for whole neighbourhood and he’s running out of supplies.
The hospitals alongwith corona beds is a danger to normal beds but all corona hospital is workable @MCGM_BMC @AUThackeray so instead of making arrangement in all hospitals for corona it’s better to have specified hospitals for corona

"There're 2 eminently honorable viewpoints:. 1) Govt is doing the right thing by thanking those who are fronting India's Corona war. 2) Such symbolic actions shouldn't take away the focus from the real battle. Why are you guys so touchy, for God's sake??!! "
Hmmm... I guess all songs are having less views as people are worried about Corona Virus... And Rightly So...

I am not going to listen to a stupid way of avoiding the Corona Virus !
What will be result of this janta curfew - As corona virus life at one place is 12 hrs and curfew is for 14 hrs so the places or points of public areas were corona may live will not be touched for 14 hrs will break the chain. What we get after 14 hrs will be a safe India .

"Interestingly this is across the world, by tyrants. And hope Corona targets and takes them."

Remember Pune is having most cases corona virus and we all know the level of crowd in banks specially @TheOfficialSBI that too bund garden branch is small and busiest so it could work as medium of spread of corona as well

Very essential & informative address by PM. Bt PM’s speech missed on most important pt which was of Whatsapp Nuisance & Social Media Fake rumours which is proving more dangerous virus then #Corona currently. I urge @narendramodi @GoI_MeitY to spread awareness &amp; restriction on dis

Economy stressed because my govt has ruined things and now Corona is ruining it more means I can blame corona..
Present shivsena govt cannot manage situation of state affected by Corona viruses.
"PM @narendramodi ji...what a fantastic address. You Motivated, Re-Assured &amp; Alerted us. We are definitely in very caring, hard-working and responsible hands. #Corona is actually a huge opportunity to demonstrate to the world that we are a great county!!!"

So many people making meme on corona! Why why...majhak chal raha hai koi..yahan fatt ke hath me aa gai hai..samras boys hostel valo ki!
@PMOIndia's address was completely bereft of ideas. Nothing about the govt's responsibility of strengthening primary healthcare. All the responsibility rests with us. And a 'Go Corona' like suggestion to clap outside homes! Does the govt have any clue about the economy.
"You have (got) to be kidding! Confirmed #Corona cases: 81,102 China 35,713 Italy 17,361 Iran 13,910 Spain 12,327 Germany 9,052 France 8,413 Korea 7,769 US 3,028 Switzerland 2,642 U K 2,056 Netherlands 1,646 Austria 1,550 Norway 1,486 Belgium 1,279 Sweden 300 Pakistan 170 India"
"Sensitive, practical, mature speech by PM @narendramodi which hopefully will wake up Corona virus naysayers and the one day janta curfew is a sign of things to come for India..addressed almost all issues affecting citizens.."
One day's 14 hour curfew and 5 minutes of clapping to the tune of Go Corona to decimate the virus that's spreading like wildfire. This truly happens only in India. This inspires zero confidence in me personally apart from not cutting wages and maintaining social distancing!
I am on curfew on Sundays for past 18 years. #janatacurfew Monday ka kya ?? #corona #india

Make a film about #corona and make 200 people sit in an enclosed space to watch it . How else will they know about social distancing 
All the 19 on return should be tested for Corona.
Flocks of people from Europe and US saying they have had symptoms like Corona virus in mid November/December. Makes you really wonder if the spread was as linear as shown below. 
Self isolation is very important to fight against Corona virus. Whole world should implement at least for 15 days. Protect yourself and protect world. Jai Hind.

@narendramodi Don't be scared of the Corona virus. Just be calm . Relax. Eat healthy. Be vegetarian. Exercise and meditate. When you sleep put OM mantra. Increase your immunity. Consume lot of vitamin C naturally. Amla juice Giloi juice Satsumas Tulsi and ginger tea
Corona Virus is good enough to avoid CPM leaders loot of Flood relief fund in Ernakulam dist. Inefficient Cong leadership and it's deteriorating situation after the resignation of Scindia. All news and 'Anthi Charcha' can be avoided.

This Corona thing is getting out of hand 
Ban poltical rallies ban IPL ban crowds from sports events failure to do so will see a expotential increase in corona virus cases Modi diverts attention from riots to corona to hoardings in UP to throwing out kamalnath Attention seeker the day corona wipes out bjp day of rrluef 
True that. We need to be prepared as #Corona is spreading and despite all efforts there would be an impact
More than 900k people die due to Malaria in Africa every year. More than 40k die due to Flu in USA. 100k die in India every year due to overspeeding &no hamlets. 17.71 million people die due to heart diseases every year. 3k death due to Corona. Dont panic and be cautious. 
"Amidst the Panic Reactions of #Corona, I Found this amazing &amp; hillarious post by a friend of mine. People doing #panic Mode Bulk &amp; Unnecessary Shopping is actually risky for them too. #Americans specially and #Indians not far behind. A big opportunity made for stockist though."
"No wonder, corona is on its prowl ."
"I learnt that people r taking pride over #Corona cases in their cities. Folks r like ""Hamare yahan bhi aagaya #coronavirus ka case"" I said,""yahan shayad ek suspect hua h case"" &amp; they were like, "" Hamare yahan to do teen cases h"" BC Indiawale to virus pebhi ghamand karne lage"
"I continue to maintain my stance that this is a correction due to valuations. Corona, Crude are just reasons. More people in US died because of Flu and use common sense rather than spreading panic . Market may go down further. But valuations playing big role in same as US"

"During 2018-19 period a total of 35.5 million ppl were infected with Influenza out of which 34.2K people died, why wasn’t it hyped as much as Corona Virus?! Maybe bcuz we know more about it than Corona. I know Corona is deadly but it’s mortality rate is low!"

"At a time of #Corona virus it should be ILLEGAL to cough or sneeze or spit in public places without a hanky or a tissue to contain it, with stiff fines enforced. Below, the folks at Alibagh Pier 16 showed it’s not impossible to have such laws. A spell check would have helped. "
@ndtv Pl do not invite people for your show of 'Bigfight 'and 'we the people ' next week to avoid collection of people. Avoid spread of corona virus .
"Spread of Corona Virus is via cough droplets and spread of communal virus is via biased &amp; selective reporting by many, i hope you understand my point."
The panic against any disease should be Fatality Rate x R0(Measure of Contagious-ness) SARS is more contagious than Corona and has a higher fatality rate. MERS is way more fatal but much less contagious. The social media rating of Corona is way higher than that of SARS or MERS.

Most people will treat it as a stigma.. COVID = AIDS in rural areas.. low income groups... and not get tested due to the social neglect they will receive if tested positive. No one thinks that they can infect other elderly people while they themselves will survive. Quite selfish

Honorable Prime Minister @narendramodi @PMOIndia as the numbers in are rising you should take a call to shut down large companies and various industries with large workforce which will safeguard from COVID-19. This will help for faster recovery.
"While some people are suffering from #Covid_19 , some sections of the society are suffering from unemployment, hunger and starvation due to the pandemic. Governments should increase efforts to protect the vulnerable classes #COVID #Covid19India #COVID2019india"

@Murugan_TNBJP Sir. Right time for tnbjp to supply masks to poor people for prevention of covid virus. Funding can be crowd http://sourced.By this way tnbjp can get recognition and also prevent xtian ngos taking advantage

Otherwise you will have 500 people queuing outside the test centre and causing more infections. Also the test kits are limited in number and should not be wasted on false cases only because someone is feeling like they might have Covid-19. They need to be saved for true cases.
You mean in Paris? Or are you in Pune? Testing for Covid is available in all covid equipped hospitals in India only for symptomatic patients. The gradient of the symptoms also matters. And frankly that is how it needs to be.

All pets are anyway vaccinated for #coronavirus This isn’t #COVID19 which is what we are fighting against ...
The Quint spread false news about India being in stage 3 of COVID19 
May God bless us from #covid19 #pandemic!
Let’s research guys? Why UN & WHO don’t confront to the real victim yet? What’s the reason behind late declaration to the global about Pandemic COVID19? Who’s getting benefits &amp; developing their economics? What’s the global distance from the origin of COVID19?
Agree. We should know the current situation of exploration of Covid19. Who is responsible for it? What’s the real story against delaying to declare? Why UN &amp; WHO don’t confront to the real victim? Who is getting the benefits on such pandemic situation? We should research on it.
