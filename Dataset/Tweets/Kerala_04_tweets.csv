Ummm... at least we and majority will soon agree / know that #SARSCoV2 and #Covid19 are real and not #stories #TakeThat #NewNormal. It needs to be looked at from a #science tinged lens and not traditions nudged in to humans by #religions - therein lies opportunity @simonsinek
Also - let’s not over simplify by making it one skill that kind of structured thinking got us here - and will not help us get out. #life is more interconnected than most of us are taught to believe so finding those #connections via science is the need of #Covid19 #NewNormal
The Power of #Purpose even when it’s against #Humanity - when empowered by #Internet #Covid19 just makes these visible
