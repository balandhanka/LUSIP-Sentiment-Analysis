Request:- Please avoid bargaining things from small vendors specially veg- fruit vendors. As due to corona there are many family who sleep without food. Your 10rs bargain may make you happy but that will give them few less chapatis. Humble request if you can

Made in China you mean. Only Corona has lasted this long among all Chinese products.

@PMOIndia @narendramodi @drharshvardhan Dear PM please do a complete shutdown of 15 days of 6 states heading with rapid force. Ask them to store 20 days stock to survive. Only doctors would be allowed to travel. No else. This is the best solution to fight against Corona.

"This is vendetta politics; Corona Lockdown is deliberately being used as a cover by the govt to eliminate dissent, certainly to be condemned. "
Great step taken. Delhi CM should go for a 15 days complete shutdown to control on this. He should ask to deploy rapid force. Nothing should be allowed. People should make arrangements for 15 days shutdown. We all should unite & fight against Corona. 
I am going to share the huge problem which the people's are facing in the area of Lucknow Teji Khera Talkatora road. Here the people's are fighting from corona as well as the problem of the railway crossing road has been blocked and many people's are facing problem with this.Etc – at RDSO
"It is already known that corona is detected in person without any symptom like cough etc, even then doctors are waiting for symptoms to arrive for covid test. If that person came in contact with a person with low immunity unknowingly, then who will be responsible?"

Are you serious. Shame on your journalism and thoughts. You are spreading fake news. You are more dangerous than Corona .
Absolutely great. To beat Corona which is a China make only Chinese devices are being used inspite of Vocal for Local appeal by the PM. What does it show ? Government guidelines are not taken seriously.
Is Donald Trump confusing a conversation about how the #Corona Virus crossed the border from China to India as border dispute dispute talks?

I have been seeing the FB these days. Many young professionals working in different areas are criticising the government on corona control policies. It sounds as if they are only experts. Irony is that they only criticise without giving any solutions. Please stop doing nonsense.
No one knows how many Corona samples are being sent for testing in govt labs n how many in Pvt labs everyday? When r results being rec'd n how many are pending each in govt n Pvt labs? Testing results within 48hrs is must to check further spread. Why this information kept secret?
However why you have disturbed the Corona graph of Delhi and now equated with UT of Maharashtra. Please do not play appeasement politics.
