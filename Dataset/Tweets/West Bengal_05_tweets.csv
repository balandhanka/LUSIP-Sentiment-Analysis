I have pillowed Corona. Going to sleep. Good night @MamataOfficial madam
It will no longer be possible for us to handle Corona.
Our fire minister Shri Sujit Basu has been attacked in Corona. I wish him a speedy recovery. I hope he will be able to work in self-glory again as before. @MamataOfficial
"After all this time, the migrant workers who are being sent home are not bringing corona, are they? Was there any problem to bring before Hon'ble @PMOIndia? If they had been brought,they would not have been afraid of being corona. Now who will guarantee that they will not corona?"
"If we weren't busy with Trump and thinking about Corona, maybe this is a bad time We didn't have to see. When our Prime Minister was busy building a wall to cover the slums, Kerala was busy with hygiene. So don't eradicate it in Kerala today. Really Kerala model we should accept."
"#Corona didn't break the #SYSTEM, #Corona exposed a broken #SYSTEM. And we have to fight together against this broken #SYSTEM.There will be a #SYSTEM where no one will be deprived of his/her rights. #BrokenSystemExposed"

Best way to beat lockdown blues... Burn calories & stay fit ... Expecting everybody to become a Tiger &amp; roar the Corona away.. Waiting for the asli TIGER to hit the screen soon &amp; break all box-office records.. @BeingSalmanKhan @TOIIndiaNews @IndiaToday @ndtv
@MamataOfficial honb'le ma'am please quarantine migrants to the government quarantine center to reduce spreading this Evil #Covid_19
The spread rate of Covid push me into the deep thoughts... May god save us from #Covid_19 ..
"Didi, you should be healthy, be good. Because if you are not healthy, we will not be healthy. You are the warrior whom neither nature nor man can stop from serving man. Every time you have saved us from communal incitement or Covid 19 or Amphan repeatedly.@MamataOfficial"
This is the reality... If little of the humanity left then praise this RSS Covid fighter... He is a Muslim 
Now it's not Covid... Few people around the dealing of the case will be sacrificed... Old filmy strategy of case proceedings in India 
"@PMOIndia please stop wine sale. Transportation of migrant labours and wine shop opening together will increase rate of Covid infection cases. We have stopped ourselves in Lock downs in all activities, please don't fail us. "
Nobel Laureate resonating Rahul Gandhi... 4.5 Cr migrants to be tested before moving and that too by Center not State... HA HA I have a pertinent question : Does Covid-19 attacks Central Nervous System too? 
"For the last one,it would be ""SCIENCE"" instead of ""GOD"".Once COVID 19 is gone,please do remember ""SCIENCE"" fought this alone,not any ""RELIGION"" or ""GOD"".We can still survive only because of ""SCIENCE"",not because of ""GOD"". Without ""SCIENCE"",we cannot survive."
Who will explain him to understand that Covid-19 has not been sent by China for luxury... Pathetic ones 
Thanx @PMOIndia Sir @narendramodi Ji for ur Excellent way to manage this #COVID__19 in India.. #IndiaFightsCorona #Lockdownextention #StayHomeSaveLives
