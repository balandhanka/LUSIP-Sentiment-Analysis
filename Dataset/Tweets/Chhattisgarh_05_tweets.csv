This is a communist heart. No concern about its own citizen. Only communists can behave like this as China behaved in spreading Corona virus all over the world. 
Corona's havoc is continuously growing in #Chhattisgarh. The figures have been increasing every day for the past few days. 68 new corona positive patients were found in Chhattisgarh today. The total number of active patients in the state was 281. #CoronaUpdates #Covid19
We need to control #Corona cases in Maharashtra otherwise this chain never will break. For this PM should take the charge over there. #Modi4Maharashtra #RahulDumpsMaharashtra #MaharashtraPolitics
Stop criticising Govt's action. You first criticise china. Corona is the contribution of a communist country. Have the guts to criticise china not the Indian govt which has been doing very well in the present day globe.
