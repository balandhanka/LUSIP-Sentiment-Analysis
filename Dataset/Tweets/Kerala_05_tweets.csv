"You need to do a program like Election on my plate it can be like corona on my plate. It will help you to understand the ground reality of the top South Indian states ,"
Corona virus is not breaking any systems. The broken systems are exposed by it.
Is it due to the over-projection of our Corona management? One Johny had the temerity to say that till the country is free of this Pinarayi should be the PM! Another hack said that the whole country wants Pinarayi as PM!
Pre-emptive strike by @narendramodi . TN Chief minister EPS had asked for Rs one lakh crore to revive India in post-corona phase. But PM releases 20 lakh crore to the economy.
"It was predicted that Corona in India will see a spike in May. That is exactly what is happening. Will not be surprised if a third wave hits Kerala starting today. While we should not be depressed seeing positive cases, it is important to focus on minimising deaths."
But Sir it is a wise move. the govt may gain ₹ 1.5 lak cr from it. This would come handy in corona exp and also infusing addl doze of support for economy without foolishly printing more currency like bolivia. The street vendor wont reduce his price ever!

It is a strange coincidence that today the USAF carried out a fly past over DC to honour Corona warriors. Tomorrow IAF is undertaking a fly past from north to south and east to west . There may not be any connect but seems surprising though ?
Tomorrow helicopters from IAF (Indian Air Force ) & Indian Navy will fly over hospitals treating Corona patients in the cities and shower petals as a tribute to efforts and sacrifice of Corona warriors. These aircraft will cover major towns starting Srinagar to Tvm @PTI_News
It's a notable Tribute Corona warriors a great thought of Armed forces

"Maharashta govt writes to Kerala requesting to provide 50 docs & 100 nurses for its new 600-bed COVID hospital at Mahalaxmi Race Course. They will be provided stay &amp; food; promised PPE. Docs to be paid salary of Rs80k (MBBS), Rs2L&amp; nurses Rs30k Do you think Kerala should oblige? "
"Maharashtra COVID-19 cases cross 50000 mark; tally 50231 after 3041 new cases. If you can't believe, read again."
"As a nation, we must learn to live with COVID, because we just can't hide from it for long. We can't shut down indefinitely. The country has suffered a lot already. Livelihoods lost, people misplaced and died. It is sad and depressing."
"And most probably, and I hope here, the covid numbers that you see are not really that of sick people. Those are people with COVID virus in them. Our recovery rates are so good. We must do our best and absorb these stranded people. There is something called home."
"It is easy to use absolute numbers to hype and create panic. Certain spike in COVID numbers were expected, once state borders were opened to help stranded people."
Malayalam TV news sells paranoia. @manoramanews is certainly the no:1 here. Hope they will find something better to sell when COVID season is over.

The biggest result of the Covid19 realisation is the rapid virtualization of businesses.
Small towns and villages become talent hotspots as the best tech talent are coming from remote locations. The high status cities lose its sparkle because of potential community spread and Covid19 impact vulnerability making it less attractive!
