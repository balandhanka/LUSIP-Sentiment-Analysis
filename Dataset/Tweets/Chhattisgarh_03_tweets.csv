"China had silenced the Dr.who identified COVID-19 and he died later. It let this brew.On the other hand, when Nipah virus was found in India,3 Dr.identified it and immediately reported it to WHO. 2000 quarantined and 17 died in total.We would have NEVER allowed it to a pandemic."

12. India has suspended all visas to India as well as visa-free travel facility for OCI cardholders.The Indian nationals coming from COVID-19 hit nations after 15 February will be quarantined for 14 days.This in contrast with the UK with far more cases no quick action whatsoever.
"10. India has sent Maldives a 14 member medical team comprising of pulmonologists, anaesthetists, physicians & lab technicians and also a large composite of COVID-19 medical relief to assist Maldives health authorities."
"4. India is leading the fight against COVID-19 in the South Asian region, offering diplomatic, humanitarian and medical assistance to its neighbours."
Not again madam Mamta banerjee . Why do you have to link everything to politics? Covid is now a global epidemic. Read before you speak. If you can’t do anything positive at least stay silent.

We had observed cases where a single person in a factory unknowingly spread COVID19.. Low or high ? If there's a chance we need to implement all precautionary measures. Being as a citizen they have the right to health &amp; safety but unfortunately we r failis procuring basic needs.

When one cannot suggest a cure for covid19 why write against foods and spices and herbs which are used in india for boosting immunity and resistance in our body? Strong possibility that this dissuading effort may have some hidden agenda.

"#COVID19 is a crisis unlike any in the 75-year history of the UN. This a moment that demands coordinated, decisive &amp; innovative action. This is, above all, a human crisis that calls for solidarity. -- UN Secretary-General @antonioguterres on #COVID19. http://bit.ly/392FzKp"
Hats off sir for your and entire health department’s efforts to control #COVID19 in Chhattisgarh
Apart from the protection in the time of distress we should prevent and address #socialstigma. Misinformation about #coronavirus &amp; #COVID19 is creating fear &amp; hostility that hurts people &amp; makes it harder to keep everyone healthy. @PriyankaJShukla @TS_SinghDeo @sidbshrestha
