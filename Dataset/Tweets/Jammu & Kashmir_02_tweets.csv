"Those who are selling masks of 10rs in 50 rs, i wish u suffer from corona virus syndrome."
"The non muslims are united and making strategies against corona virus but we muslim (the owner/contractor of paradise) are increasing the prices of mask and then we will perform hajj with that money and write a hajji with name O ALLAH, we are ashamed "
All I see is corona virus and psl on twitter:((
Next time when we point to India and it’s treatment of minorities perhaps we should first see how we treat our own #DelhiRiots2020 #Corona 
For the prevention of Noval Corona Virus do exactly opposite of what are Mullahs are asking to do.
So is your theory that America created corona virus in China so that we can infect China and Muslim countries?

Catch me live tomorrow in 92News Morning Show probably at 9:10am. Topic of discussion will be Corona Virus...
I am currently talking about pakistan as the mainstream media is exagirating corona context.
Corona virus is a form of flue and has a fractional mortality rate in comparison to seasonal influenza. Don't panic and take necessary precautions.
In UAE also rumours and jokes about corona virus is considered a crime https://amp.arabianbusiness.com/amp/article_listing/aben/culture-society/439148-jokes-rumours-about-coronavirus-crime-in-uae
"lol while in we were debating abt social media’s new regulations, looks like the world already had such a thing in place as two Indonesians were arrested for spreading fake news abt corona virus #CoronaVirusUpdates"
"Mortality rate of corona virus is 2.1%, less than typhoid (9-13%), malaria and TB. so, not everyone who gets it, is going to die. Please don't panic. Stay strong. Spread awareness. College of physicians &amp; surgeons Pakistan. #copied Awareness"
"Should we blame the govt or ourselves -due to two cases of corona in Pakistan ,today the masks rates are at the peak.The govt didn’t ask the shopkeepers to rise the rates but it’s our selfishness.#ARYNewsUrdu #GeoNews #HamzaAliAbbasi"
All the people who are involved in the price hike of face masks for protection from Corona Virus should be shameful of this act. This is the time to show some substance as a nation. Help each other. Facilitate each other. #coronavirus #Pakistan
"How ajeeb this nation is, taking corona into memes. Zinda dil qoum! #CoronavirusOutbreak"
Corona virus in Islamabad . May Allah protect us all. Ameen #cronaviruspakistan
THE ONLY PROTECTION I GOT! After being refused masks. Also Islamabad is having confirmed corona cases &amp; the pharmacies are setting a new low. #coronavirus #wegotnomasks
**Corona virus Alert** Do not Shake Hand &amp; Hug Avoid gathering. Improve Immunity Take plenty of water Take night Sleep for 7-8 hrs. Take home made Cooked food. Do not share any thing each other. Avoid Sneezing &amp; Coughing openly. Try to use good Quality Mask #APUBLICSERVICMSG
"-Don’t forget that of 82,585 COVID19 Cases 33,259 hav recovrd where jst 2,814 hav died. -Whch means we have 46,512 current Corona pts worldwide. -Many cases must have gone unreported &amp; cured as COVID19 is a self immune disease,i believe it’s Case fatality rate is way below 2%."

"Influenza has a higher death rate than corona buddy. And lets be honest. We’re worried because out of all epidemics and deadly diseases in Pakistan, this is the only one which can reach the rich. Cold as it may sound."
China succeeded to defeat Corona virus. 
How are all those who wanted to die and now afraid of Corona... #Coronaviruspakistan
More chances at dying of Corona than finding love lmao
Cold as it may sounds. The only reason I see for the fear over the looming epidemic is this: Corona virus can reach the rich. More people can/will/do die of hunger and water-borne diseases and any other contagious disease but those don’t threaten the elite.
Nahi we are worth it let us all die with Corona Virus starting from Dr Arif Alvi
"Do not panic corona virus for hours,who rays pigs,cats,dogs,and donkey "
"Corona virus for to hurts,says pigs,dogs,cats and donkey,do not panic for poor muslims "
"Do not panic,Corona virus only for to eats pige.dogs.cats and donkey .not hurts muslims "
Some signs of corona infection how can someone know if he he or she is infected.But this is not always right. Share this. #CoronaVirusUpdates #coronavirus
As we know Corona viruse has initially hit Pakistan in order to stop it we should make mask available to the community at all levels but we being Islamic Republic of Pakistan have raised mask price so that it should spread more and more!! Salute to the people who Wana earn on it.
From” Love in the times of Cholera” to” Love in the times of Corona” the humanity has come a long way.
Registered cases of Corona Virus would perhaps increase in Pakistan in the coming days. While it may be a matter of concern but Please don't panic. Survival rate is extremely high alhamdulilah at almost 98%. Keeping good hygiene is recommended!

Welcome to corolla after corona
"This means WAZU is the KEY to betterment and the BEST precaution. Even if we take 9 hours supposedly for CORONA VIRUS to enter into our body, the next namaz comes for which you perform WAZU. And then within 9 hours the next comes, hence there are major chances for any virus"
"Corona Virus takes approx 48 hours to enter inside the human body. Now here is the surprising news, once the virus is on your skin it can not do anything, while you wash that area of your skin it might wash off aswel"
"THE CORONA VIRUS. Virus is a microorganism that is known as non living outside the body and living while it enters the human body. On the surface, each virus has its own time of entering the body, flu virus takes 9 hours while the rest might take 24 hrs to 9 weeks."
All Government and Private schools will remain closed on 27th and 28th feb due to corona virus meanwhile University students will be taking their classes as per the schedule kyun k wo insaan ni hai.

Corona Virus: Myth-busters: 
"Corona virus has been reported in Karachi. The virus has entered Pakistan via Iran through pilgrims. However, after the 1st week of March, the effects of the virus will automatically dissipate, however, the use of water. and full of meat Avoidance can protect us from this virus "
"Not even a day since the first patient of Corona virus is reported in Karachi and the price of N-95 masks has reportedly shot up by over 300-500%! Next time you feel like Aurat March or Zindagi Tamasha will damage our “culture”, know that there is nothing left to be damaged."
3 Cases of #Corona Virus infections found in #Peshawar. All three are afghans. What is our Border management Doing

ARY not reporting that is spreading the PANIC regarding CORONA Please be the Profasional not just the business ICON 
Sad news: There are 2 cases of Corona Virus in Pakistan
Karachi must be sealed off from the rest of Pakistan. Must be checked if any of the people these victims of Corona met people who travelled outside of Karachi. Immediate effects need to be taken. Pakistan can’t be susceptible to it spreading to other cities.

How come the Corona virus jumped India &amp; Pakistan went straight for Iran. It's highly contagious but the mortality rate is 2-3% which is lower than SARS and MERS too I think (I could've googled but that's how lazy Iam)
"SAPM on Health, Dr Zafar Mirza denies all the rumours and clarifies that there are no corona virus cases found in Pakistan - and also explains the measure taken by the govt to prevent it from coming to Pakistan. @zfrmrza @ovaismangalwala #CoronavirusOutbreak"
"Neighbouring countries are suffering from Corona Virus. Instead of calling federal health minster and get briefing from him on this issue, he is more interested in inquiring about the status of NS’s health. Such a douchebag "
"Corona virus spreading all world, should be ready. "
"Corona virus in Iran after China, who is direct beneficiary? My guess is US. If true Ugliest approach as usual."
"But still there are many slips between a cups and the lips. Corona Virus would definitely play its role. It is a Wrath of Almighty Allah. How long it would persist, i don't know. How many would perish worldwide. Who knows? Pakistan would emerge as a great country.......... "

What a shame!! People curse Imran Khan for mismanagement and once they find an opportunity they happily increase price of N95 Face Mask after knowing about COVID-19 in country. What a nation we are 
Chinese experience shows that COVID 19 peaked out in 2 to 3 months with unprecedented stringent containment measures It may take much longer to peak out and generate extraordinary number of cases in countries where containment measures are lax.The 2% fatality rate may also go up
Unfortunately: A Case in Pakistan 
Thank God

I believe Pakistani can defeat the covid-19. But it’s necessary for a good control like China
