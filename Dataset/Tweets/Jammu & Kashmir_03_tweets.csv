Some Jokers who call themselves journalists are blaming Imran for not being able to control rising cases of Corona virus. These guys sit in their AC offices and don't understand that our people simply refuse to observe precautions. Poor areas are crowded. The virus will spread.
@ImranKhanPTI sir please share the corona relief fund account number on your twitter timeline and pin it to your profile.

PM Modi is very much correct in saying that it is very important to break the chain of corona virus by distancing from one another... India has the highest population density per sq km...which is approximately 3 times higher than China...hence will be very difficult to contain..

This is the reason when you put your medics down than many departments in your country. Corona ll bring medics on the top willing or unwilling. #CoronaFreePakistan
It's good and positive attitude that people are taking it serious. Cantt(along with big cities) goes into complete lockdown. Have to curtail this Corona contagion before whole system collapses. Stay safe/social distancing and don't panic. 
In Oct 2007 China already wrote a research article on Corona virus. That's why we need to have a lot of researchers/scholars in policy making bodies.

Corona is at 2nd stage in India. Reports said 63 new covid cases in day. Now we all are duty bound to protect our Nation. So aware your near &amp; Dears about this deadly virus by using social media.

Too late and it seems now we will pay price of not going into countrywide lockdown too in coming weeks. PTI Govts reluctance of going to IMF for a year is still costing our economy and same will be the case of Corona if we won’t go for countrywide lockdown timely.
