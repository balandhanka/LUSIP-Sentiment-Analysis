One mssg fr Rahul three or four Mnstrs leave their work and start offering their takes to prove they hv no work in their respective Mnstrys!! But when they sit and think they wl realise there is sense in what he is saying.He had warned the Govt in Feb to b serious re Corona but..
"Don't know if this can be counted as an achievement, but managed to shed a few kgs during the #lockdown #Covid_19 #Corona"
"That’s great news , we need to be prepared before monsoon as the cases may rise.We all are together in this fight to defeat Corona Virus . "
Prasad in confidence might agree that Rahul has not twisted any facts.He had warned Union Govt to take Corona virus seriously IN FEB ITSELF.The Govt shudhv declared Lockout in Feb effective1Mar and arranged Migrants shifting by Sp Trains. Centre delayed for MP Govt it is at fault

@HardeepSPuri State Government is busy with fighting against Corona. Central govt. must listen to them. Starting flights in a phased manner with frequency manageable by local authority is required rather than giving blanket permission.
The babus just got the whole thing wrong. Migrants should have been fed locally. Travel stopped strictly. (Else got them home in the first 2 weeks). Now they are corona carriers infecting everyone. SS and our states also were at fault.
Aurangabad recovery rate of Corona patients is good
Goa chief minister Dr Pramod has also done inspirational corona control
@aajtak roj same news repeat karne se achcha hai ki aap dusri city cover kare. Not even single news of Pune. If u can cover city like Rajgad and other small cities thn y not Pune ?? Pune is big IT hub. Having 4.5k corona cases. What else u need to run the business.

@PMOIndia Maha govt unable 2 control Corona in Mumbai. There’s no info on their preparedness. Media is taken care of possibly. Why doesn’t Centre come forward n rescue Mumbai fm Corona grip? What’s stopping it? Finally such risks will end up affecting all of India. @narendramodi
Corona has become a threat for prisoners as they don't have space for isolation &amp; older prisoners are at high risk of infection. Sant Shri Asharamji Bapu must be released soon in such situation due to #CoronaRiskInJail
Police and doctor's are dieing due to protect people But indian politics never change they can't work together in any condition. In initial days we thought opposite and ruling party working together to handle corona condition #indianpolitics #MaharashtraDrohiBJP
"Jodhpur jail has 27 Influenza-like illness (ILI) patients, 58 chronic disease patients & old prisoners. Such people are at high #CoronaRiskInJail. Is Govt waiting for Corona crisis in there too, like other prisons of the nation? Release them on parole. "
Indian jails are already overcrowded. Social distancing is also impossible to maintain due to the huge crowd. Jails can be hot points for corona. Due to #CoronaRiskInJail grant parole to prisoners bcoz they are safe in their homes instead of jails.
pls cheer up to this great corona warriors 
"While every country is making efforts to keep prisoners safe from corona, the Indian government must also take steps towards it by releasing old prisoners having more than 60 years of age. #CoronaRiskInJail"
"The society is not safe from corona even after following so many http://precautions.Now in jails, there is lack of good hygiene and health care facilities. Indeed, there is significant #CoronaRiskInJail"
There are more danger and risk of corona in prison. Because there is neither cleanliness nor there is social distancing obeyed. So there is a high risk to spread corona in prison. #CoronaRiskInJail
"Today, while talking about social distance, prisoners in the prison are becoming Corona positive, which has more elderly prisoners, so the government should release the elderly prisoners on parole. #CoronaRiskInJail"
If this happens I am sure corona problem will be over. Truth is homoeopathy though efficacious cannot stand unless proved scientifically. But who will fund for Research ?
"Corona is a pandemic and is highly infectious. In most prisons, the risk of infection has increased due to the high number of prisoners. Hence for the sake of safety and to avoid the rapid infection, elderly prisoners should get parole immediately. #CoronaRiskInJail"
"We are seeing that no of corona cases have already increased in Jaipur, Udaipur central jails. Now the government should do something for the safety of prisoners. #CoronaRiskInJail"
Prisons can easily become corona hotspots because of closed and congested environment. Moreover prisons are prone to infections due to lack of social distancing. #CoronaRiskInJail
Then why Christ is not saving american people from corona virus
"Prisons can easily become Corona hotspots because of closed n congested environment, no proper ventilation. Due to lack of space, social distancing is impossible Hence release prisoners as there is considerable #CoronaRiskInJail"
There are more than 10 or 20 inmates in a jail cell and the majority of the corona infections occur where the crowd is more because this virus is more prone to chain reaction. #CoronaRiskInJail
8yrs old #CoronaWarrior defeated corona at bulghana dist Maharashtra &amp; also a 94yrs old too defeated corona 
#CoronaRiskInJail The prisoners are at high risk of Corona virus effect as there is lack of cleanliness and social distancing in Jails.
"Right.Corona is a pandemic and is highly infectious. In most prisons, the risk of infection has increased due to the high number of prisoners. Hence for the sake of safety and to avoid the rapid infection, elderly prisoners should get parole immediately. #CoronaRiskInJail"

ICMR may disclose the average age of 4337 fatalities of Covid. Our PM says that 21st century is ours and that we are responsible. In that case PM must disclose all facts. There cannot be only responsibility without knowing the real facts!
"Generating 50 cr CFO on an avg for 5 years per Covid, ie trading as 60x CFO even now. Unable to achieve MRP on sales (product sells at a discount). No growth/ consistency in EBITDA margins, indicating lack of a brand. China dependency And now the travel issue. Classic value trap."
This is the reality which we all need to see! That's it. Why always make a fuss about it. And right now the main focus is to save our lives from Covid and not all this. Help others probably we all will feel good! Peace

I totally agree with you sir..!! Bt tell the nation that if u were the prime minister of India then what formula or strategy u will apply to fight against #Covid_19 ?
Covid 19 test Or jus thermal screening ? As only thermal screening is on at Entry and Exit but no Testing. You won't get testing results immediately
