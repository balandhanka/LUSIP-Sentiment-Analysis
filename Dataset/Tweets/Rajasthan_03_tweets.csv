Is PM tacitly following the British immunity herd model to manage corona ie when most ppl get it &amp; hence develop an immunization then the chances of spread reduces significantly? British PM is getting a slack because of it. A big bet though. 
His smile shows that his intentions are strong. they can easily fight the corona virus. They are the heroes of the public service. We hope that they will surely rescue the people of Sindh from the #CoronaVirus. #ProudOnSindhGovernmentHeros
