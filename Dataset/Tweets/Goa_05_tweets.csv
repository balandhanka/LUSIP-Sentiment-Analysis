@narendramodi @realDonaldTrump Good decision by @POTUS . China purposefully allowed corona virus spread over the world. We Indians support you. World need to take strong actions against Chinese communist party. Let's come together and teach a lesson to China.
"Meanwhile some news of relief here from Goa..., Active Corona cases drop down to 28. Hope to become Corona free State again before Monsoon..."
Corona has also given us a sense of humour
Update: Three #COVID19 patients have been cured and discharged from ESI Hospital. Active cases in the state now stand at 28.Our team is working hard to fight the virus and make #Goa a corona free state: HM @visrane

Consider corona virus is warm-up. Worst is yet to come. 
Will not survive corona
He doesn't have to spit or do anything intentionally.. untimely sneeze or cough is enough these situations have crossed my mind.. and having wrote this am now even more paranoid thinking of orders/eating at restaurants 'before corona' 
"If AMERICA is a super power...now is the time to show it.Send a few jets and bomb them..ur next OSAMA might be hiding there.CORONA killed more Americans then OSAMA did, so that way u should hunt CHINA down faster."
Good sign for #Odisha that recovery ratio is more. Congratulation to Corona warriors...

Sir good alternative career option Post corona
For corona he should blame China because it is a bigger menace
So ? What does being a surgeon have to do with Corona Virus ?
Corona is cultivating bad habits in us
We specialise in looking the wrong way. We are waiting for a Santa Claus to save us when the victory is in our hands. Why can't we understand such a simple thing that wearing masks and maintaining distancing are two powerful vaccines with us to fight Corona
Corona is changing everything. From mindsets to weather
One day we will have corona also in matching colours
But by hiding behind lock down we will take double beating. More and more infection's with mortalities and economic suicide. We cannot avoid the corona impact. Either we bite the bullet and get out of it fast or drag it. The damage in terms of numbers will be the same
Corona has chewed our senses
Corona will answer your first question. The other two will take another century.
Corona times all colours look yellow
Good alternative career option Post corona
It will be after corona
No masks no distancing. Corona times
Is some competition announced that We are running helter skelter to declare ourself corona free
Human life is a cheap commodity in this country. When it became clear in February that corona is a communicable disease and can be avoided by distancing and wearing masks we should have taken the onus on ourselves.
Have the rules of the game changed midway. At this rate we will be corona free in the next two days. @Indepthcomments
Corona has chewed my senses
Please take covid test as Mahadev will also require a corona negative certificate. Please take care. Your life is precious
Please be careful with corona
Anything possible in corona times
Love in the time of Cholera! Suitable for Corona times as well. One of my favourites from Marquez.
And we are a 21st century India. 2 months into the lock down can't figure out that distancing and masks are the only two vaccines available against corona
Two things that scare us of dying abruptly with corona: Unmarried: I din get laid enough Married: I Din get to format my phone 
If they had worn masks it would have been a perfect picture. Afterall corona times. @maryashakil
A burning Corona moment
These are our natural traits. We have ourselves defeated the fight against corona by not maintaining distancing
Put masks on them. Corona times
They should have put a mask before releasing him. Corona times
Collateral damage of corona
Please put a mask on his face. Corona times
No distancing no masks. Corona times
Corona and it's thought control us
Hope they are not carrying corona in their hand baggage
With monsoon will come another set of problems. The usual friends malaria dengue chicken gunya. How will we segregate them from corona is a million dollar question @PoulomiMSaha
Delivery failed. Corona times
Yes the Rafael jets will now fight the Corona virus! 
Please get him to fight Corona @PoulomiMSaha @NPDay
"Another set of problems. The usual monsoon sicknesses malaria, dengue etc. How to segregate them from corona is a million dollar question"
Three simple guidelines Wear mask maintain distancing and personal hygiene. Only vaccines available against corona
When they say the Corona situation in India is all Modi’s and his government’s fault 
You guys have no better work to do other than criticising hard working CM & HM - come with your better suggestions to CM instead of criticism - at this hour of covid crisis u all should cooperate and join hand with Govt to fight with CORONA - don’t loose GF credibility 
All myths are busted. Distancing and wearing masks with hygiene are the only vaccines against corona.
Hope corona uncle doesn't come in your dreams
Protect it from corona by making him wear mask and maintain distancing
Be careful. If Corona uncle sees vodka with lemonade he will come after you
The problem squarely lies with us. If we wear mask and maintain distancing we can surely avoid corona. Nobody has stuffed it in our mouth
And all this even as people of the state are suffering. Corona on one side and Amphan on the other
Till how many months this quarantine shit go on! Doesn't make much sense anyways corona is here to stay
Yes will sale the SBI bank adroble offers Corona season 50 % discount onely hand cash accept 
You should rephrase as ready to welcome corona carriers
No masks no distancing. These are Corona times
Corona has increased the temperature of Delhi. As the cases increase it will get hotter and hotter
Please make them wear mask and follow distancing. These are Corona times
Please maintain distancing. That is our only vaccine against corona alongwith masks
No distancing no masks. Corona does not give space for emotions
Wear mask and maintain distancing. These are two vaccines against corona
We are not maintaining distancing and wearing masks the two vaccines against corona. Hence we are suffering
Corona affected accounts
Most innovative idea on such a mass scale. If used on mass scale this Will be the third vaccine alongwith masks and distancing against corona
"We are not maintaining distancing, the only vaccine available against corona alongwith masks"
Post Corona We may have to follow
It is a sign of people disregarding the lock down and in turn showing scant respect for distancing which is the only vaccine available against corona
Everyone is tired of corona. It has entered every facet of our life. Even it has not spared our dreams
Whatever be the justification but distancing and masks are the only vaccines available against corona at the moment. The Mumbai story is a pure result of non adherence
This is real disgrace All these elected MLS’s are least bothered about GOA’s plight. - busy looking after self interest- inhuman rogues No one there besides CM or HM - both these guys working tirelessly to combat corona-19 - the opposition just there to criticism disgusting 
Now is time to start writing your next book. How we mishandled corona @sardesairajdeep
Yes... I was booked to goa but flight got canceled. Waited through 1.0... then came lockdown 2.0....3.0... 4.0.....!!! Corona virus isn't going away in a hurry... &amp; goa is home &amp; work!!!
Corona will take offence. He will come after you as he is short tempered
Is corona a night duty security guard?
Corona virus has provided these goons with a mask!
Corona has chewed your followers
It is affected by corona
These are dangerous time's. Corona sells better than amphan
Sir anyhow 80 percent of corona patients will recover. Please focus on the tests as the real fight lies there.
Many companies/businesses/sectors will go under post corona. These are just the initial signs
Due to corona mosquitoes have also started wearing masks
Don't thank Corona because if he listens you will be in trouble
Corona chewed your followers
We are corona negative. How is anyone's life in danger?
Awh Godi Media. Same TOI says 87% of India is Happy seeing the way Govt has handled Corona Virus 
I hope his colour did not change due to corona or pollution
First one looks like corona chacha
My heartfelt sympathies for the people of #Odisha and #WestBengal for going through the tough times of #CORONA as well as today's #AmphanSuperCyclone.. The entire nation is with you. #StaySafe
The 3rd repatriation flight from Italy landed with 81 seafarers of Goa. The process of taking swabs commenced .Big thanks from TEAM GOA to the CORONA WARRIORS doing the great service to mankind. THANKS AGAIN @AAI_Official @MoCA_GoI @dgcaindia @MoHFW_INDIA @AAIREDWR @visrane – at Dabolim Goa International Airport (GOI)
As if corona was not enough. Pray for every bodys safety
Get your facts straight. I Never criticized goa. I showed the dismal state of the quarantine facility to express how dangerous it was for goa & goans to have it unsanitised like that as it becomes a breeding ground for corona. It was to PROTECT goa. U should in fact support it.
Till then we can see the corona tara
What an absurd statement. If I have focused for 2 months being hyper about sanitization & kept myself corona free &amp; travel in a santised car 2 a sanitised home in goa. Dont u think its RIDICULOUS 2 put us in a room thousands sleep in without sanitising it&amp; risk infecting us?
In these times of the #CoronaPandemic Everything will burn down to ashes but we must rise like the Phoenix. #corona #WednesdayThoughts #WednesdayVibes
Yes!! I am a #CORONA #WARRIOR .. fighting for your health and safety. #RespectDoctors.. #ManipalHospitals #StayHomeStaySafe
We have no issues with rules. Or quarantine. But if the facilty is filthy and not disinfected and I risk getting corona because 1000 people have stayed without it being sanitised.. and it creates a risk for me to get it.. thats the issue. .. may I also add we paid for the room.
Hahahha . Seems this is what people are thinking. CORONA is like a Immigration Agent at the border Check Post and it will scan only non residents.
"It's not about Goans or Non Goans, at least not for CORONA. I am talking about accepting living bad and unhygienic conditions ."
"Remember corona is not going away soon. If u are getting panicked, plz pack urself in room for next 5 years or go to cryogenic sleep... plz dont blame any one like uneducated fellows. We have to live with Corona now. All authorities are being working towards it #StayHomeStaySafe"
Corona virus is not going away on a specific date. It may be a year before a vaccine is found. .. and it will still take a couple more years to eradicate if at all..... Is goa ( dependent on tourism) going to disallow people for the next 3 to 4 years?
Wear mask. These are Corona time's
Corona has chewed all the investments of SoftBank
This is the quality of education and values we impart. How can people even think of being a part of such vulgarity and that too in these dangerous corona times.
Maintaining distancing and wearing masks are the only two vaccines available against corona. Hence request every Indian to comply to save ourselves
"Firstly, My fiance maneck contractor has a goan aadhar &his passport says goa as well. Besides, How can u say the masses of goans with aadhar cards returning home are corona free? Aadhar card doesn't make a person or state corona free. Wheres the logic?"
"The lack of hygiene & sanitization makes it a BREEDING GROUND for viruses. People who enter goa WITHOUT corona may get it at such a badly sanitised quarantine centre. I TWEETED out of CONCERN 4 the safety of others... BUT all people can focus on is that ""a celebrity entered goa""?"
KARMA is a CORONA sometimes 
Request all Mumbaikars to maintain distancing and wear masks to avoid corona. Please Free the police from this duty to do better things for us
To get elected he should promise Pakistan of finishing corona
"I m in disaster problem, plzzzz help me. My contact details 9034918301.I m businessman in dry fruits in Goa. I came Margao, Goa by train on 16th may from Delhi. After my corona testing i m having negative report n home Quarantine 14 days. Why my landloard evicting me???????"
Good alternative career option sir post corona
"Koppal district reports first three Corona positive cases, all having history of inter -state travel #KOPPAL"
Without mask in corona times
No social distancing no mask's. Corona times
Because the government thinks corona is a night duty security guard
Mask please. Corona times
Where is the Mask. Corona times
Corona will take Pakistan with it
Corona is a night duty security guard
@goacm will solely responsible for #Covid19 Goa disaster. Goans had sacrifice during lock down but #BJPSarkar importing #Corona by train by putting Medicos and citizens at risk @girishgoa @digambarkamat @VijaiSardesai @visrane @GoaGmc
First let the trains spread corona then we will give flights the chance
@realDonaldTrump Your somersaults since outbreak of the Corona virus in US are making many Americans turn away from you. Look at the ever rising death toll. Over 86k and rising. You sound more like a charlatan. November could see the end of your Presidency.
"I think the day is not far when government will start flashing migrants fatalities parallel to the corona fatalities, not to forget number of migrants ""successfully"" returning home in parallel to patients recovering from Covid19. @IndianExpress @TheQuint @thewire_in"
We have entered a new phase of corona wherein people from outside are carrying the virus with them. We need a strategy to counter this
Please make him wear mask. Corona times
Corona happened! 
"Pls watch n listen Opposition party critics, reactions & Economic expert Comments by(EX-FM-UPA) regards 2 Mega Relief Package of Rs 20 lakhs Crores 2 furthermore include or corrections2 reach Needy in Corona crisis period Modi Govt &amp; Finance Minister spokes person reply 4 same "
Don't be a pessimist. Corona is a normal virus and only co morbid are at risk
Sir people will lose job's. Post corona every employment opportunity is precious
Please tell them to maintain distancing and wear masks. These are Corona time's
"Feminism is bravery of the kind woman journalists like Barkha Dutt, Neelam Pandey, Purva Chitnis, Zeba Warsi, Vijaita Singh have shown in battling corona in its stronghold"
Don't jump the gun. What has gone can always come back. Run a campaign in your area tasking each individual to maintain distancing and wearing masks. We can prevent corona on our own by taking the above two vaccines
Corona has interfered in every aspect of our lives
Corona is affecting the weather also
This is the 'Corona Jaap' by BJP leader Vineet Agarwal 
Make that 8 Corona cases in Goa at the moment. Goan residents coming home themselves are not COVID free and the #Goa government were ready to welcome Tourists ?
How did you celebrate #worldcocktailday2020 ? I give you Sharona's Corona. A coffee based cocktail with a citrus tang after taste to sip through these hot summers . It's quite simple. Do give it a shot. Here's… https://www.instagram.com/p/CAKOLBOn49k/?igshid=d698cjaa025q
The rush to break news in corona times pump's up the adrenaline
Team Goa Airport is like a Rolls Royce. Minimum noise maximum efficiency. Come On corona we will beat you hands down.
Hold there are some today and feni in Corona time is inaccessible
Have they done an assessment of how many businesses/sectors/companies will sink post corona before distributing money. Or we intend perpetrating another scam
The fight against Corona is in our hands. Maintain distancing and wear masks. Pandemic hitting us was anyhow overdue
But have you factored the number of small companies and businesses that will go bust after corona
"One great thing abt journalism in Corona times is the power of woman journalists. Barkha Dutt, Neelam Pandey. Zeba Warsi .Rana Ayub Purva Chitnis Vijeta slogging it out on the field and male heavy weights enjoying the warmth of their studios @BDUTT @NPDay @ChitnisPurva @vijaita"
Monsoon also affected by Corona?
Dont worry Mumbai will be corona free soon. State government has already started exporting corona. Goa got 7 of them today.
First we have to see how many msmes survive post corona. I frankly see many of them sinking because demand is going to shrink badly. Instead we should have pumped in huge money into agriculture and make it profitable. Remember the most vulnerable belong to rural India
"If we have this type of ministers running the country, then I guess we are doomed Corona or no corona"
"1st case of Corona Virus in #Goa after being declared a Green Zone. Imported from 'singe source' Ahmedabad, Gujarat! #NamasteTrump #GOAFightsCOVID19"
Yeah green zone toh means we are immune to Corona! Let's not patrol the borders and focus on catching people with no helmets. Cause thats where the money is... Right?

Ideas of people like you would have been of immense help in corona times. Unfortunately​ in our country ideology contrary to ruling class is treated inimical and ignored.

"Maharashtra Police has stood by citizens thro' calamities, attacks & disasters. Today as they lead the war on Corona on the streets, I've decided to celebrate them by changing my DP on Twitter, Facebook, Instagram, etc to the Maharashtra Police logo. Join me in this endeavour "
Please ensure these are standalone profit centres and self sustainable in the long run so that such models are replicated accross the country. Agriculture and it's ancillaries hold the key to our prosperity post corona and your initiative is a wonderful beginning
Be careful of bats. They brought corona
Please ensure he wears a mask. Corona times
Goa administration is foolish . When there are no cases of Corona virus in Goa does it make sense to wear a mask? This is only harassment for the people of Goa! 
Dear Rahulji why UR spending sleep less nights after this PM care http://fund.It is not owned by Modiji it is trust 4 welfate of Corona affected PM very honest no doubt will spend in best possible way will audit fund UR not bothered about Corona bothered about money only

Please name the book Cuisine in corona times
It is time we think of coming up with more coperatives like Amul in other products to get India going Post corona
By the time we learn to deal with Corona Virus it will mutate into something else. The virus is mutating into several strains. And before we know it Humans will adapt to it. So life goes on. Lift the lockdown and move on.

People must now demand the Delhi model of Mohalla Clinics. Private hospitals are nothing but money making rackets put up by politicians. So they will not treat Corona patients or even the general patients and the government hospitals are not adequate enough or competent enough. 
Me thought the Emperor had instructed employers to pay their salaries while they sit out the Corona virus but what is this Mukesh Ambani is to pay fifty percent of salary to employees. Electoral Bonds Jai Ho!

these are the same people who aggressively deny entry of maids and sweepers in society due to covid 19!!! But masquerade as good samaritans when comes to #COVID__19 twitter!! these idlers have nothing to do but picking holes in all and sundry!!

How long would this quarantine shit work ? Covid is here to stay !! Aint going anywhere for couple of years

"Now there are no other better topic left for fighting except #Covid_19 for Indian politicians today. Topics like corruption, religion, scams and many others will get a good break."

Yes surely. Wearing masks and distancing are the only two vaccines We have against covid now
It symbolises our government losing it's way in the fight against covid
It has a finite universe. We will be better served if we can do antibody tests or something equivalent By which we can find out how many are immune on account of having recovered from covid
Will send with COVID negative certificate :3
Too expensive for us esp after COVID 19

"@BJP4Goa Sawant is a flop as CM. Just days after he said that Goans have been made aware about Covid 19, Goa went from zero positive cases to 50+ due to goof-up by him. How were people from outside Goa allowed to enter when they were already infected? Why interstate trains halt?"
For that it is not necessary to only test less. Who declares the figures every day. Even in deaths they have found ways. Afterall nobody actually dies of covid. They are covid induced deaths. So leaves a lot of scope for interpretation
Wht a sorry state of these poor people and we are celebrating the war against Covid 19 which our leader have imposed on us for no fault of us. One day the leaders might even give themselves a award for this but will they sleep peacefully when all this could have been avoided

@timesofindia The slipup by a Kerala minister about the identity of a Covid 19 person has been blown out of proportion. The bigger blunder is that CM Sawant allowing Delhi south bound trains to halt in Goa. Now 39 confirmed cases including many who came by train. He is step down.
