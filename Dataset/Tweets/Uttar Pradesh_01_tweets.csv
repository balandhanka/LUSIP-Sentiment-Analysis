What is corona virus? 
"This is the latest advisory about technical guidance from WHO for care of cases diagnosed or suspected of Move Corona virus infection, "
"Thanks RT PCR for Corona virus will not diagnose Novel Corona Virus, a mutant strain and cause of the present epidemic in China, when ever the test for Novel strain of Corona Virus will be available, the safety regulations will be needed for its use,"

On a more serious note — what is the government’s response to the Corona virus? It has reached Nepal and could easily transfer across the land border. Indian cities are the perfect place for a virus like this one to spread like wildfire: deeply congested and poorly sanitized.
"No, I don't even know the test to diagnose corona virus and their availabilty so far. Diagnosis will be clinical with a history of travel from China or contact with person suffering from disease."

"No. Actually the pathogenic micro organisms need about 100 years to be capable for the outbreak of newer epidemic disease, more often caused by the non scientific human behavior. This time the outbreak of Corona virus is due to the bad feeding habits of the Chinese people. Bat. "
"Chinese Premier Li Keqiang visited Wuhan the epicenter of Corona virus . He went to hospital, talk with infected patients and discuss with concern authorities.This is an example of an intimate relationship existing between the Chinese communist leadership and the Chinese people."

Stop everything!! Something bigger than Corona virus has just happened!
"The more I see news and learn about Corona outbreak, the more panicked I am about all these. If Nepal has an epidemic like that in Wuhan, god knows how fatal that would prove!"

Meanwhile in Nepal. Just can't imagine Corona spread 
"Govt gave order to hospitals be ready to treat Corona virus. Is that enough?That's how govt plan ?we don't have facility to confirm the disease,we need to rely on WHO, India and other countries.Teku hospital discharged the pt before the confirmation of the report."

Stop Chinese citizens from entering India due to corona virus infection . Even China has stopped transportation to and from from one of its cities from which it started .
