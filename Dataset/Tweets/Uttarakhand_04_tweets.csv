#SupportCoronaWarriors PPE kits mandatory for all medical teams/staff working in: (i) hospitals treating corona patients. (ii) corona testing labs. (iii) health care workers rendering services door-to-door. #AIIMS #Uttarakhand
#CoronaPandemic only way to contain this is send medical teams door-to-door and do more-and-more tests. PPE kits mandatory for all medical teams serving in field or in hospitals treating corona patients. any negligence will lead to a situation like we have in #AIIMS #Uttarakhand.
in this high time of corona pandemic i feel ashamed to see the neglected state of medical team visiting our villages in the hill districts who even don't have the access to proper protection gear and are seen performing their duties wearing a face mask for dust protection only.
