"Why 12% GST on Gloves in this terrible crisis of Corona? If you want to fight with Corona, then finish GST with these similarities #GSTFreeCorona"
Govt of India on its low ! Charging 12% to 18% GST on items which plays most important role to fight this pandemic. SHAME ! Stop earning tax and make this available for all at lower price! Together will fight this Corona ! #GSTFreeCorona

The rest of the world got infected by corona because of china. But India was safe with less than 100 infected until T.Jamaat deliberately spread its throughout the nation. #कोरोना_जमाती_वायरस
More than 90% of corona cases in India are directly linked to T.Jamaat Imagine the total number of infected indirectly. No. of cases are doubling every other day. only because of these evil people india has crossed 5500 mark with 119 deaths. #कोरोना_जमाती_वायरस
similar jamaats were found to be cause of wide spread of corona in other nations too. #कोरोना_जमाती_वायरस

What world need is 2 convict China 4 their hiding of corona cases &amp; the deadly virus contagious trait. As its proven by seeing no. Of cases in dev. Countries which R higher than them. This will have more impact than blaming it 4 creation of a virus which literally have no proof.
We must not go outside otherwise we will get infection of dangerous Chinese corona virus which is spreading through contact and we will definitely defeat this epidemic by locking us in home #SupportLockdownStaySafe
